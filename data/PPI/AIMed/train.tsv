False	The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of  <e1> actin </e1> , suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/ <e2> dystrophin </e2>  family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain.

False	Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and  <e1> simian virus 40 T antigen </e1>  have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to  <e2> Rb </e2> .
False	The amount of  <e1> CDK4 </e1>  and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of  <e2> CDK2 </e2>  associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells.

True	 <e1> FGF-7 </e1>  recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the  <e2> FGFR2 IIIb </e2>  isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR.
False	Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii)  <e1> p52Shc </e1>  and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the  <e2> IGF-IR </e2> , and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR.

False	RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP: <e1> TTR </e1>  ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP: <e2> TTR </e2>  ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

False	In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the  <e1> hGHR </e1>  and  <e2> hPRLR </e2> , and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap.

False	The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/ <e1> dystrophin </e1>  family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and  <e2> NR2B </e2>  subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain.

False	In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the  <e1> hGH </e1>  receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on  <e2> hGH </e2>  overlap.
False	Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with  <e1> RbAP46 </e1> ; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with  <e2> RbAP46 </e2>  for binding to Rb.

False	Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with  <e1> HVEM </e1> /TR2 and  <e2> LTbetaR </e2> , thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death.
False	Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase  <e1> c-Abl </e1>  are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that  <e2> ATM </e2>  might interact with c-Abl in response to radiation damage.
False	Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the  <e1> TPO </e1>  receptor and five anti- <e2> TPO1 </e2> -153 monoclonal antibodies.
False	We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core  <e1> hTAFII </e1>  present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 ( <e2> hTFIID alpha </e2>  and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart.
False	SHPTP2 associates with the platelet-derived growth factor ( <e1> PDGF </e1> ) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of  <e2> SHPTP2 </e2> .
False	Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either  <e1> TFIIB </e1>  or RPB5 in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that  <e2> HBx </e2>  transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and TFIIB.
False	These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76  <e1> IL-7R </e1> , and not with expression of the p90  <e2> IL-7R </e2> .
False	Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing  <e1> LexA </e1> -Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an  <e2> Abeta </e2>  fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others.
True	A 51-residue region from the conserved C-terminal region of  <e1> TBP </e1> , previously shown to be the binding site for the viral activator protein E1A, interacts with c-Fos and  <e2> c-Jun </e2>  proteins.
True	 <e1> LEC </e1>  induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and  <e2> CCR8 </e2> .
False	The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to  <e1> TrkA </e1> , maintained  <e2> neurotrophin-3 </e2>  binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB.
False	Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/ <e1> BR-Ia </e1>  and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also  <e2> BR-Ia </e2> / BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand.
False	We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single  <e1> gp130 </e1>  molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with  <e2> gp130 </e2> .
False	Crosslinking of iodinated  <e1> acidic FGF </e1>  (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) to transiently expressing COS-1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa, which was competed for by both  <e2> aFGF </e2>  and bFGF.
False	Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the  <e1> insulin </e1>  receptor ( <e2> IR </e2> ) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae.
False	Cross-family dimerization of transcription factors Fos/ <e1> Jun </e1>  and  <e2> ATF </e2> /CREB alters DNA binding specificity.
False	RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP:TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar  <e1> RBP </e1> : <e2> TTR </e2>  ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

False	Our finding that  <e1> HBx </e1>  directly interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), a common subunit of RNA polymerases, implies that  <e2> HBx </e2>  directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase (Cheong, J. H., Yi, M., Lin, Y., and Murakami, S. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 142-150).
True	A  <e1> gp120 </e1>  fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with  <e2> CCR-5 </e2>  only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule.
False	Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins ( <e1> procollagen I </e1> , collagenase, elastin,  <e2> hyaluronic acid synthase 2 </e2> , hyaluronidase, fibronectin, cd44, fibromodulin, and decorin) across cell passages (3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 for tracheal scar) revealed varied growth patterns.
False	The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether  <e1> TNFalpha </e1> , alpha-1-antitrypsin ( <e2> alpha1AT </e2> ), and complement factors C3 and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion.
False	Residues in human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) crucial for binding to both the human LIF receptor (R) and  <e1> gp130 </e1>  were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of  <e2> hLIF </e2>  in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity.
False	We found that  <e1> ADA </e1>  was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either  <e2> ADA </e2>  or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity.
False	These findings indicate that the  <e1> Fos </e1> /Jun and ATF/ <e2> CREB </e2>  families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought.
False	The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast  <e1> Snf2 </e1>  protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/ <e2> Snf </e2> .
False	Secreted  <e1> LT-alpha </e1>  is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha- <e2> LT-beta </e2>  complex.
False	Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named  <e1> RIP </e1> , for  <e2> receptor interacting protein </e2> .
False	Monomeric (IL-6M) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor ( <e1> sIL-6R </e1> ) and gp130 have been purified in order to investigate the effect of  <e2> IL-6 </e2>  dimerization on binding to the receptor complex.
False	Consistently, LEC was found to bind to  <e1> CCR1 </e1> , CCR2 and  <e2> CCR5 </e2>  with relatively low affinities.

False	Association of  <e1> CDK4 </e1>  with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of  <e2> CDC37 </e2>  and HSP90.
False	Antibodies to  <e1> CD9 </e1>  did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to  <e2> laminin 1 </e2> , type IV collagen and fibronectin, but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic.
False	The molar ratio of serum retinol-binding protein ( <e1> RBP </e1> ) to  <e2> transthyretin </e2>  (TTR) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children.
False	Some HBx substitution mutants, which had severely impaired transacting activity, exhibited reduced binding affinity with either TFIIB or  <e1> RPB5 </e1>  in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HBx transactivation requires the interactions of both RPB5 and  <e2> TFIIB </e2> .
False	An  <e1> E2F </e1>  complex containing mainly E2F4 and  <e2> pRb2 </e2> /p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex).
True	Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of  <e1> p52Shc </e1>  is required for its association with the IR and the  <e2> IGF-IR </e2> .
True	Further studies on the interaction of HLA-E with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that  <e1> HLA-E </e1>  associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing ( <e2> TAP </e2> ) and calreticulin, and that HLA-E expression is TAP-dependent and tapasin-dependent.
False	These results indicated that HBx is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and TFIIB through communication with  <e1> RPB5 </e1>  and  <e2> TFIIB </e2> .
False	PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than  <e1> PDGF-AB </e1>  and  <e2> PDGF-BB </e2>  on several mesenchymal cell types.
False	The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to  <e1> Bcl-2 </e1> -independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and  <e2> BAG-1 </e2> .
False	Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein ( <e1> TBP </e1> ) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of  <e2> TBP </e2>  and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here.
False	A region of the beta subunit of the  <e1> interferon alpha receptor </e1>  different from box 1 interacts with Jak1 and is sufficient to activate the  <e2> Jak </e2> -Stat pathway and induce an antiviral state.
False	An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and  <e1> pRb2 </e1> / <e2> p130 </e2>  (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex).
True	Interestingly, both GRB2 and  <e1> phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase </e1>  can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same  <e2> IRS-1 </e2>  molecule, suggesting a mechanism whereby IRS-1 could provide the core for a large signalling complex.
True	 <e1> Bcl-2 </e1>  also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and  <e2> Bcl-X-S </e2> .
False	The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of  <e1> actin </e1> , suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and  <e2> NR2B </e2>  subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain.
True	 <e1> CSA </e1>  protein interacts with  <e2> CSB </e2>  protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH.
False	We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the  <e1> erythropoietin </e1>  (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ( <e2> EPO-binding protein </e2>  or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells.
False	Monomeric ( <e1> IL-6M </e1> ) and dimeric (IL-6D) forms of Escherichia coli-derived human IL-6 and the extracellular ("soluble") portions of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and  <e2> gp130 </e2>  have been purified in order to investigate the effect of IL-6 dimerization on binding to the receptor complex.
False	Transcription factor TFIID consists of  <e1> TATA binding protein </e1>  ( <e2> TBP </e2> ) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs).
False	Based on the structure of the closely related  <e1> lymphotoxin alpha </e1> -tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the  <e2> FasL </e2>  homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods.
False	Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of  <e1> IL-15 </e1> , and IL-15 competed for binding with  <e2> IL-2 </e2> , indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.
True	Interactions of the  <e1> Bcl-2 </e1>  protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S,  <e2> Mcl-1 </e2> , and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system.
False	An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 ( <e1> E2F </e1> -G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing  <e2> E2F </e2>  complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex).
False	 <e1> Granulysin </e1>  has been identified as an effector molecule co-localized with  <e2> perforin </e2>  in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of perforin and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells.
False	We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein ( <e1> TBP </e1> )-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast  <e2> TAFIISPT3 </e2> , but has no known Drosophila counterpart.
False	p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified  <e1> hsp90 </e1>  complexes along with  <e2> hsp70 </e2>  and another protein, p60.
False	Furthermore,  <e1> p21 </e1>  blocks the ability of PCNA to activate  <e2> DNA polymerase delta </e2> , the principal replicative DNA polymerase.
False	Here we show that a complex of  <e1> gp120 </e1> , the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural  <e2> CCR-5 </e2>  ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8).
True	Transthyretin ( <e1> TTR </e1> ), a second major CSF protein, formed SDS-stable complexes with  <e2> A beta </e2>  and significantly decreased the rate of A beta fibril formation.

True	It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both  <e1> lymphotoxin beta </e1>  receptor ( <e2> LTbetaR </e2> ) and HVEM/TR2 receptors.
False	Here we show that the general transcription factor  <e1> TFIIF </e1>  is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor ( <e2> SRF </e2> ), which binds to the c-fos promoter.
True	The TAFII55-interacting region of  <e1> Sp1 </e1>  was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila  <e2> TAFII110 </e2> .
False	The protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene is known to interact with several proteins, including  <e1> Grb2 </e1> , Crk and  <e2> PI3 kinase </e2> , and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors.
False	Levels of  <e1> p16 </e1> (INK4a) and p57( <e2> KIP2 </e2> ) rise in HUCs during progressive passages, whereas only p16 increases in HPEC cultures.
False	Many of the same signaling molecules, including  <e1> protein kinase C </e1>  (PKC),  <e2> tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase </e2>  (P13-K), and protein phosphatase, regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters.
False	Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of  <e1> Rb </e1>  protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional  <e2> Rb </e2>  pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro.
False	Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed  <e1> MyoD </e1>  activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of  <e2> E2F </e2>  activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle.
False	P60 can bind either  <e1> hsp70 </e1>  or  <e2> hsp90 </e2>  independently and in an ATP-independent manner.
False	Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the  <e1> insulin receptor </e1>  (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the  <e2> insulin receptor </e2>  substrate-1 (IRS-1).
False	Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with  <e1> HVEM </e1> / <e2> TR2 </e2>  and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death.
False	We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and  <e1> hTFIID beta </e1>  respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel  <e2> hTAFII </e2>  which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart.
True	The amount of CDK4 and  <e1> CDK6 </e1>  associated with  <e2> p27 </e2>  does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells.
False	Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/ <e1> BR-II </e1> , BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/  <e2> BR-Ib </e2> , and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand.
False	Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of  <e1> hTAFII28 </e1> .  <e2> hTAFII18 </e2>  also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30.
False	Our analyses demonstrate that the  <e1> XPB </e1> , XPD,  <e2> p44 </e2> , and p62 proteins interact with each other.
False	However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by  <e1> neuregulin-2 </e1>  is mediated by ErbB3 and/or  <e2> ErbB4 </e2>  receptors.
False	 <e1> Hepatitis B virus X protein </e1>  is a transcriptional modulator that communicates with transcription factor IIB and the  <e2> RNA polymerase II subunit 5 </e2> .
False	Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines  <e1> interleukin-1 </e1>  ( <e2> IL-1 </e2> ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1).
False	Two lines of evidence support the notion that  <e1> RbAP46 </e1>  and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated  <e2> Rb </e2>  proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with RbAP46 for binding to Rb.
False	Moreover, while  <e1> ITF-2b </e1>  inhibited the  <e2> creatine kinase </e2>  promoter, it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site.
True	We screened for proteins that bind to  <e1> PS1 </e1>  from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the QM/ <e2> Jif-1 </e2>  gene.
True	 <e1> TAFII55 </e1>  is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including  <e2> Sp1 </e2> , YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain.
False	Cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8,  <e1> IL-10 </e1>  (Immunotech, France), endothelin-1, and  <e2> soluble cell adhesion molecules </e2>  (sCAM) sP- and sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 (R&D, UK) have been determined using ELISA kits (photometer, Biomek-1000, Beckman, USA).
False	The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between  <e1> IL-11 </e1>  and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether  <e2> IL-11 </e2>  shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6.
False	Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and  <e1> Fas </e1> -FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants  <e2> Fas </e2> -LPR and Fas-FD8.
False	Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the  <e1> p75 neurotrophin receptor </e1>  and the p140trk ( <e2> trkA </e2> ) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF.
False	The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R).  <e1> rIL-10R </e1>  expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to  <e2> hIL-10 </e2> .
False	Due to its increased affinity for the IL-6R but its decreased ability to couple with  <e1> gp130 </e1> , we suggest that a stable IL-6 dimer may be an efficient  <e2> IL-6 </e2>  antagonist.
False	This suggests that one domain of IFN-gamma is sufficient to recruit  <e1> I <e2> FN-gamma </e1>  R alpha </e2>  and IFN-gamma R beta into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity.
False	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/ <e1> d <e2> ystrophin </e1>  related protein </e2> , and the Torpedo 87K protein.
False	In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the interaction of the Grb2/ <e1> c-Cbl </e1>  complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non-tyrosine (c-Mpl) and tyrosine kinase ( <e2> c-Kit </e2> ) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation.
False	Since  <e1> hsp90 </e1>  and  <e2> hsp70 </e2>  do not readily associate on their own, it appears that p60 is the central organizing component of an hsp90-p60-hsp70 complex.
False	By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with  <e1> CNTFR alpha </e1>  and not with the beta-components,  <e2> gp130 </e2>  and LIFR.
False	Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric ( <e1> BR-II </e1> /BR-Ia and BR-II/ <e2> BR-Ib </e2> ) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand.
False	By contrast the Ras exchanger factor ( <e1> Sos1 </e1> ) was not detected in anti- <e2> c-Cbl </e2>  immunoprecipitates suggesting that Grb2/Sos1 and Grb2/c-Cbl are present in different complexes.

False	We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin ( <e1> EPO </e1> ) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in  <e2> EPO </e2>  binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells.

False	Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link  <e1> FGFG3 </e1>  to  <e2> mitogen-activated protein kinase </e2> .
False	Our results indicate that the  <e1> trkA </e1>  and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity  <e2> NGF </e2>  binding sites.
False	Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the  <e1> TATA-binding protein </e1>  (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component ( <e2> SNAPc43 </e2> ) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here.
True	PI 3-kinase activity and the regulatory p85 subunit of  <e1> PI 3-kinase </e1>  associated with  <e2> CD5 </e2>  in pervanadate-stimulated, but not in unstimulated thymocytes.
False	For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors,  <e1> CCR-5 </e1>  and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor  <e2> CD4 </e2>  (refs 1-6).
False	Unlabeled  <e1> TNF-alpha </e1>  and  <e2> TNF-beta </e2>  were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled TNF-alpha to TNF-R expressing cells.
False	Deletion of the complete active-site [des-(161-228)- <e1> MMP-1 </e1> ] within the catalytic domain, or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain (His199), generates stable forms of  <e2> MMP-1 </e2>  proteins which are unable to digest collagen type I or beta-casein.
False	In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human  <e1> dystrophin </e1>  related protein ( <e2> DRP </e2>  or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin.
False	Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants  <e1> Fas </e1> -LPR and Fas- <e2> FD8 </e2> .
True	The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained  <e1> neurotrophin-3 </e1>  binding equivalent to  <e2> TrkC </e2> , and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB.
False	Thus, our data show that both  <e1> calnexin </e1>  and  <e2> calreticulin </e2>  interact with Glut 1 in a glycosylation-dependent manner.
False	In addition, activation of  <e1> PI 3-kinase </e1>  was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by  <e2> gastrin </e2>  to activate PI 3-kinase.
False	Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human  <e1> p53 </e1>  are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human  <e2> mdm-2 </e2> -p53 protein in vitro.
False	An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the  <e1> cyclinA </e1> /cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts ( <e2> E2F </e2> -G1/S complex).
False	Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for  <e1> MIP-1beta </e1>  binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for  <e2> MCP-2 </e2> , but only 30% for MIP-1beta.
False	Antibodies to CD9 did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to  <e1> laminin 1 </e1> , type IV collagen and  <e2> fibronectin </e2> , but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic.

False	Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated Rb proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with  <e1> RbAP46 </e1>  for binding to  <e2> Rb </e2> .
False	In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and  <e1> F <e2> GFR3 </e1>  IIIc </e2> , that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain.
False	Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/ <e1> Flk-1 </e1> , while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with  <e2> FLT-1 </e2>  binding.
False	Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the  <e1> myogenic basic helix-loop-helix </e1>  ( <e2> bHLH </e2> ) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130.
False	In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti- <e1> IRS-1 </e1>  immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by  <e2> gastrin </e2>  to activate PI 3-kinase.
False	In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for  <e1> p60 </e1>  can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing  <e2> heat shock protein 90 </e2>  (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early PR complexes containing hsp70 and Hip (p48).
False	Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of  <e1> B61 </e1> , a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by  <e2> tumour necrosis factor-alpha </e2> .
False	Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor  <e1> NF-kappaB </e1> , via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase ( <e2> NIK </e2> ) [8].

False	In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and  <e1> TBP </e1> -associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by  <e2> TFIID </e2>  or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.
False	In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta ( <e1> PKAII beta </e1> ) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit ( <e2> RII beta </e2> ) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs).
False	The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton.  <e1> alpha-Actinin-2 </e1> , a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of  <e2> actin </e2> -binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95. alpha-Actinin-2 binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain.
False	Gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of  <e1> insulin </e1>  receptor substrate 1 and its association with  <e2> Grb2 </e2>  and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

False	In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and  <e1> Bcl-2 </e1>  provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either  <e2> BAG-1 </e2>  or Bcl-2 protein alone.
True	The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a complex of membrane cytochrome b558 (comprised of subunits p22-phox and gp91-phox) and three cytosol proteins ( <e1> p47-phox </e1> ,  <e2> p67-phox </e2> , and p21rac) that translocate to membrane and bind to cytochrome b558.

False	Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor ( <e1> IR </e1> ) and the  <e2> IGF-1 receptor </e2>  (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae.
True	We used alanine substitution of  <e1> EBP </e1>  residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and  <e2> EPO </e2>  binding.
False	p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of  <e1> Rb </e1>  by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and  <e2> cyclin D2 </e2> -Cdk4 complexes.
False	Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant  <e1> PTF </e1>  gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable  <e2> TBP </e2> -TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation.
True	Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast UBC9, designated  <e1> UBE2I </e1> , that interacts with RAD52,  <e2> RAD51 </e2> , p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1.
False	TRADD- <e1> TRAF2 </e1>  and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct  <e2> TNF receptor 1 </e2>  signal transduction pathways.
False	Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and  <e1> IRS-1 </e1>  bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc,  <e2> IRS-1 </e2>  binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR.
False	 <e1> SHPTP2 </e1>  associates with the platelet-derived growth factor ( <e2> PDGF </e2> ) receptor after ligand stimulation, and binding of SHPTP2 to this receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPTP2.
True	The death-inducing receptor  <e1> Fas </e1>  is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein  <e2> Fas ligand </e2>  (FasL).
False	Overexpression of  <e1> FADD </e1>  in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the  <e2> interleukin-1 beta </e2> -converting enzyme.
False	These data demonstrate that the  <e1> p90 </e1>  IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76  <e2> IL-7R </e2>  have different extracellular domains.
False	Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/ <e1> TNF-R2 </e1>  cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three  <e2> TNF-R2 </e2>  molecules.
True	Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with  <e1> RIP </e1> , another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with  <e2> Fas </e2>  antigen.

True	We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of beta 1-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the  <e1> dystrophin </e1>  binding site on  <e2> beta 1-syntrophin </e2>  occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.
False	The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors ( <e1> TRADD </e1> , FADD/ <e2> MORT </e2> , RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily.
False	 <e1> TAP </e1> - and  <e2> tapasin </e2> -dependent HLA-E surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide.
False	Mutational analysis of p60 indicates that the N terminus is required for  <e1> hsp70 </e1>  binding, and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding  <e2> hsp90 </e2>  and hsp70.
False	We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2c) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands  <e1> FGF7 </e1>  or FGF10 and the epithelial splice form of FGFR2 (FGFR2b) to be activated by  <e2> FGF2 </e2> , FGF6, and FGF9.

False	Microinjection of anti- <e1> cdc25A </e1>  antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and  <e2> cdc25B </e2>  display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1.
False	Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric  <e1> gp120 </e1>  binding, although with variable potencies; maximal  <e2> gp120 </e2>  binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta.
False	The  <e1> HFE </e1> -TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of  <e2> HFE </e2>  in regulating iron homeostasis.
False	Jak1 and Jak3 associated with  <e1> IL-2R beta </e1>  and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced  <e2> Jak3 </e2> -IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations.
False	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of  <e1> dystrophin </e1> , utrophin/ <e2> dystrophin </e2>  related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.
False	Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the  <e1> Bcl-2 </e1>  family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and  <e2> Bax </e2> , were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system.
False	When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a  <e1> GM-CSF-R </e1>  showing a single class of affinity (KD = 2(-8) nM) and specificity for human GM-CSF but not  <e2> interleukin-3 </e2> .
False	This  <e1> Syk </e1> -Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with  <e2> Lyn </e2>  in vitro.
False	However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or  <e1> p107 </e1>  binding is mediated by the  <e2> E2F </e2>  subunit.
False	Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas- <e1> FD5 </e1> , a mutant of  <e2> Fas </e2>  possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8.

True	Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric (BR-II/BR-Ia and  <e1> BR-II </e1> / <e2> BR-Ib </e2> ) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/ BR-Ib, and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand.
False	Peptide growth factors, as well as the immediate early gene products  <e1> c-Jun </e1> , v-Fos, and  <e2> c-Myc </e2> , inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with E2A products.
False	The findings suggest a model whereby  <e1> Bax </e1>  and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate  <e2> Bcl-2 </e2>  function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.
False	Cloning and characterization of  <e1> hTAFII18 </e1> , hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor  <e2> TFIID </e2> .

False	Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and  <e1> hIL-10R </e1> -expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of  <e2> IL-10 </e2> .
False	We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and  <e1> hTAFII18 </e1> . hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast  <e2> TAFIISPT3 </e2> , but has no known Drosophila counterpart.
False	Microinjection of anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A and  <e1> cdc25B </e1>  display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either  <e2> cyclin B1 </e2>  or B2 but not A or D1.
False	These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the  <e1> cdc25 </e1>  tyrosine phosphatase, of which  <e2> cdc2 </e2>  is the physiological substrate.
True	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like  <e1> beta 1-syntrophin </e1> , both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/ <e2> dystrophin related protein </e2> , and the Torpedo 87K protein.
False	By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays, PS1 was shown to accelerate the translocation of  <e1> QM </e1>  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of  <e2> c-Jun </e2>  homodimer to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE).
False	We further showed that CD26 was comodulated on the T cell surface with  <e1> CD45 </e1> , a known membrane-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti-CD26 was capable of precipitating  <e2> CD45 </e2>  from T cell lysates.

False	Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/ <e1> TR2 </e1>  and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing  <e2> LIGHT </e2> - mediated HT29 cell death.
False	In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for p60 can, on the one hand, inhibit formation of mature PR complexes containing heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), p23, and immunophilins and, on the other, enhance recovery of early  <e1> PR </e1>  complexes containing hsp70 and Hip ( <e2> p48 </e2> ).
False	The precise function of c-Cbl in these pathways is not clear, although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that c-Cbl is a negative regulator of the  <e1> e <e2> pidermal growth factor </e1>  receptor </e2> .
False	The high affinity  <e1> interleukin-6 </e1>  (IL-6) signaling complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components: a low affinity but specific  <e2> IL-6 </e2>  receptor and the affinity converter/signal transducing protein gp130.
False	In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76  <e1> IL-7R </e1>  is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned  <e2> IL-7R </e2> .
False	Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine  <e1> myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 </e1>  (MPIF-2)/ <e2> eotaxin-2 </e2>  to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340).
False	Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by  <e1> c-Jun </e1> /c-Jun but not by  <e2> c-Jun </e2> /c-Fos heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1.

False	We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin ( <e1> EPO </e1> ) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO.Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the  <e2> EPOR </e2>  (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells.

False	Two lines of evidence support the notion that RbAP46 and simian virus 40 T antigen have homologous Rb-binding properties: first, several mutated  <e1> Rb </e1>  proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with RbAP46; and second, both T antigen and T peptide (amino acids 101-118) were able to compete with  <e2> RbAP46 </e2>  for binding to Rb.
False	The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. alpha-Actinin-2, a member of the spectrin/ <e1> dystrophin </e1>  family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95.  <e2> alpha-Actinin-2 </e2>  binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain.

False	Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the  <e1> Bcl-2 </e1>  protein, since a LexA protein containing  <e2> Bcl-2 </e2>  amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218.
False	We found that ADA was associated with  <e1> CD26 </e1>  on T cell lines lacking either  <e2> ADA </e2>  or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity.

False	This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since  <e1> Syk </e1> -Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with  <e2> Lyn </e2>  in vitro.
False	 <e1> CD30 </e1>  and its counter-receptor CD30 ligand (CD30L) are members of the TNF-receptor/ <e2> TNFalpha </e2>  superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation.
False	In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and  <e1> TBP </e1> -associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a  <e2> TBP </e2>  complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.

False	These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or  <e1> Stat5 </e1>  is directly recruited to the ligand-activated  <e2> IL-10 </e2>  receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine.
False	Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and  <e1> PTF </e1>  delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable  <e2> TBP </e2> -TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation.

True	Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in F9 cells showed that PS1 suppresses transactivation by c-Jun/c-Jun but not by  <e1> c-Jun </e1> / <e2> c-Fos </e2>  heterodimers, consistent with the reported function of QM/Jif-1.
True	We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3  <e1> IL-6 </e1>  variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single  <e2> gp130 </e2>  molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130.
False	We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human  <e1> GITR </e1>  ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related ( <e2> mGITR </e2> ) protein [4].

False	RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP:TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in  <e1> RBP </e1> :TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548).

False	However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either  <e1> pRB </e1>  or  <e2> p107 </e2>  in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit.
False	SF3a interacts with U2 snRNP in the presence of  <e1> SF3b </e1>  to generate a structure similar to 17S U2 snRNP, which suggests a function for  <e2> SF3a </e2>  and SF3b in the incorporation of U2 snRNP into the spliceosome.

False	Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a approximately 140-kDa glycoprotein ( <e1> IL-4R </e1> ) and the gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds  <e2> IL-13 </e2> .
False	The predicted amino acid sequence of  <e1> hIL-10R </e1>  is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to  <e2> hIL-10 </e2> .

False	RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar  <e1> RBP </e1> :TTR ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in RBP: <e2> TTR </e2>  ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548).

True	In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but  <e1> hGH </e1>  binds to both the hGHR and  <e2> hPRLR </e2> , and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap.

True	Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein-DNA complexes show that the coiled-coil is flexibly joined to the basic regions and that the  <e1> Fos </e1> - <e2> Jun </e2>  heterodimer does not recognize the asymmetric 5'-TGAGTCA-3' recognition element in a unique orientation.

False	The activity of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of actin, suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton.  <e1> alpha-Actinin-2 </e1> , a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor-clustering molecule PSD-95.  <e2> alpha-Actinin-2 </e2>  binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 from rat brain.
True	Here, we demonstrate that  <e1> E2F-1 </e1>  may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-kappaB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-kappaB subunit,  <e2> p50 </e2> .

True	Only weak  <e1> IL-13 </e1>  binding activity was found in cells transfected with only  <e2> IL-13Ralpha </e2> ; however, the combination of both IL-13Ralpha and IL-4Ralpha resulted in substantial binding activity, with a Kd of approximately 400 pM, indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL-13 receptor.
False	We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and  <e1> hTFIID </e1>  beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d) <e2> TAFII30 beta </e2> . hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart.
False	Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the biological activity of IL-15, and  <e1> IL-15 </e1>  competed for binding with IL-2, indicating that  <e2> IL-15 </e2>  uses components of the IL-2 receptor.
False	Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope-tagged receptors, we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric ( <e1> BR-II </e1> /BR-Ia and BR-II/BR-Ib) and homomeric (BR-II/BR-II, BR-Ia/ BR-Ia, BR-Ib/  <e2> BR-Ib </e2> , and also BR-Ia/ BR-Ib) oligomers in the absence of ligand.

False	FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the  <e1> FGFR2 IIIb </e1>  isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to  <e2> FGFR1 </e2> , FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR.
False	Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of  <e1> hTAFII28 </e1> . hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and  <e2> hTAFII30 </e2> .
