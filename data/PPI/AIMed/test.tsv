False	Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that  <e1> Bcl-2 </e1>  homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing  <e2> Bcl-2 </e2>  amino acids 83-218.

False	Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that  <e1> Bcl-2 </e1>  homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing  <e2> Bcl-2 </e2>  amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218.

True	In vitro, purified  <e1> G beta gamma </e1>  subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 ( <e2> Raf/330 </e2> ).
True	In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the  <e1> 87K postsynaptic protein </e1>  from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated  <e2> beta 1-syntrophin </e2> .
True	The  <e1> hGH </e1>  and hPRL receptors ( <e2> hGHR </e2>  and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily.
False	We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes  <e1> hTAFII28 </e1> , hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d) <e2> TAFII30 beta </e2> . hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart.
False	Using the human RAD52 protein as the "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast  <e1> UBC9 </e1> , designated UBE2I, that interacts with RAD52,  <e2> RAD51 </e2> , p53, and a ubiquitin-like protein UBL1.
True	The  <e1> retinoblastoma protein </e1>  associates with the  <e2> protein phosphatase type 1 </e2>  catalytic subunit.
False	Molecular cloning and expression of the 32-kDa subunit of human  <e1> TFIID </e1>  reveals interactions with  <e2> VP16 </e2>  and TFIIB that mediate transcriptional activation.
False	Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for  <e1> MIP-1beta </e1>  binding could also compete for monomeric  <e2> gp120 </e2>  binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta.
False	The interactions between GRB2 and these two proteins require ligand activation of the  <e1> insulin receptor </e1>  and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to phosphotyrosines on both  <e2> IRS-1 </e2>  and Shc.
False	The gamma chain of the  <e1> interleukin-2 </e1>  (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional  <e2> IL-4 receptor </e2>  and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect.
False	RESULTS: After 7 days hospitalisation, molar RBP: <e1> TTR </e1>  ratio (mean+/-s.d.) of infected children (C-reactive proteins>10 mg/l) was 0.67+/-0.31 in the high-dose group (n=81), 0.74+/-0.44 in the low dose group (n=71) and 0.73+/-0.39 in the placebo group (n=81). These values did not differ significantly (one-way ANOVA P=0.472). In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations<0.70 micromol/l, changes in  <e2> RBP </e2> :TTR ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups (one-way ANOVA P=0.548). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of malnourished hospitalised children, molar RBP:TTR ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

False	These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not  <e1> Stat1 </e1>  or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated  <e2> IL-10 </e2>  receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine.
False	The binding of  <e1> hTAFII28 </e1>  and  <e2> hTAFII30 </e2>  requires distinct domains of hTAFII18.
False	Here we show that beta: <e1> beta activin </e1>  binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase  <e2> SKR2 </e2>  to form ActRII.beta:beta.
False	In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of  <e1> p85 </e1> , might be one mechanism used by  <e2> gastrin </e2>  to activate PI 3-kinase.
False	The cross-reactivity of  <e1> gp130 </e1>  is apparently due to a chemical plasticity evident in the amphipathic  <e2> gp130 </e2>  cytokine-binding sites.
False	Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine  <e1> IL-10 </e1>  receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for  <e2> Stat1 </e2>  or Stat5.
False	In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned  <e1> IL-7R </e1> , thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned  <e2> IL-7R </e2> .
False	Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT ( <e1> herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L </e1> ) and Fas ligand (FasL/ <e2> CD95L </e2> ).
