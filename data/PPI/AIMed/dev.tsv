False	Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing  <e1> Bcl-2 </e1>  amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing  <e2> Bcl-2 </e2>  amino acids 83-218.

False	Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both  <e1> EPO </e1>  and  <e2> EMP1 </e2> , even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

True	The binding of  <e1> IL-1alpha </e1>  or IL-1beta to  <e2> IL1R </e2>  is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs.

False	In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the  <e1> hGH </e1>  receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and  <e2> hPRLR </e2> , and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap.
True	Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human  <e1> p53 </e1>  are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus  <e2> E1B </e2>  55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro.

False	No binding between  <e1> p59fyn </e1> (T) and  <e2> CD5 </e2>  was detected in T cells.
False	 <e1> IL-7 </e1> -driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90  <e2> IL-7R </e2> , the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity.
False	Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the  <e1> IL-2 receptor beta </e1> .( <e2> IL-2R beta </e2> ) and common gamma (gamma c) chains.
True	Thus  <e1> HOX11 </e1>  is a cellular oncogene that targets  <e2> PP2A </e2>  and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters.
False	These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and  <e1> ATF </e1> / <e2> CREB </e2>  families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought.
False	It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and  <e1> HVEM </e1> / <e2> TR2 </e2>  receptors.
False	FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1,  <e1> FGFR2 </e1> , and  <e2> FGFR4 </e2>  but interacts poorly with KGFR.
False	The HFE- <e1> TfR </e1>  complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on  <e2> TfR </e2>  and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis.
False	A comparative study of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  and  <e2> stromelysin-3 </e2>  expression in de novo and ex adenoma carcinoma of the colorectum.
False	The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of  <e1> NGF </e1>  equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to  <e2> TrkC </e2> , and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB.
False	Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to  <e1> p52Shc </e1> , IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the  <e2> IR </e2>  and the IGF-IR.
True	Shared and unique determinants of the  <e1> erythropoietin (EPO) receptor </e1>  are important for binding  <e2> EPO </e2>  and EPO mimetic peptide.
False	The 2.8 A crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and  <e1> TfR </e1>  shows two  <e2> HFE </e2>  molecules which grasp each side of a twofold symmetric TfR dimer.
False	We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding  <e1> EPO </e1> .Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR ( <e2> EPO-binding protein </e2>  or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells.
False	Characterization of the  <e1> CD30L </e1>  binding domain on the human CD30 molecule using anti- <e2> CD30 </e2>  antibodies.
False	The death-inducing receptor  <e1> Fas </e1>  is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein  <e2> Fas </e2>  ligand (FasL).
False	The SH2/SH3-containing protein  <e1> Vav </e1>  also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and Vav has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the  <e2> TCR </e2> .
