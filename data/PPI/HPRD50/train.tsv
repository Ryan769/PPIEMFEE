False	Thus, the ability of  <e1> pVHL </e1>  to degrade Hif1 alpha depends in part on its interaction with TBP-1 and suggests a new mechanism for Hif1 alpha stabilization in some  <e2> pVHL </e2> -deficient tumors
False	By constructing deletion mutants, we identified that amino acid residues 229-309 of Akt were involved in the binding to  <e1> Hsp90 </e1>  and amino acid residues 327-340 of  <e2> Hsp90beta </e2>  were involved in the binding to Akt
True	Immobilized  <e1> FGFR4 </e1>  also bound  <e2> FGF-8 </e2>  besides FGF-1 and FGF-2
False	Immobilized FGFR4 also bound FGF-8 besides  <e1> FGF-1 </e1>  and  <e2> FGF-2 </e2> 
False	 <e1> TR2 </e1>  orphan receptor functions as negative modulator for androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells  <e2> PC-3 </e2> 
False	In this report, we demonstrate the stable association of  <e1> PLCgamma1 </e1>  with AP180 in a clathrin-coated vesicle complex, which not only binds to the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of  <e2> PLCgamma1 </e2> , but also inhibits its enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner
True	The protein was named  <e1> GC-GAP </e1>  for its ability to interact with  <e2> GAB </e2>  proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42
False	In contrast to  <e1> OX1R </e1> , the potency of direct activation of CB1 was not affected by co-expression with  <e2> OX1R </e2> 
True	Expression of  <e1> GC-GAP </e1>  in 293T cells led to a reduction in active  <e2> Rac1 </e2>  and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA
True	In this work, we show that  <e1> Gadd45b </e1>  and Gadd45g specifically interact with the  <e2> Cdk1 </e2> /CyclinB1 complex, but not with other Cdk/Cyclin complexes, in vitro and in vivo
False	TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of  <e1> pVHL </e1>  and complexes with pVHL and  <e2> Hif1 alpha </e2>  in vivo
True	The sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) of the  <e1> LDL receptor </e1>  (LDLR) promoter mediates  <e2> oncostatin M </e2>  (OM)-induced transcription of the LDLR gene through a cholesterol-independent pathway
True	Characterization of EC and SMC  <e1> PGs </e1>  bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by  <e2> decorin </e2>  and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
False	Subsequent amino acid sequencing revealed many peptides involving involucrin cross-linked either to itself or to a variety of other known CE protein components, including cystatin alpha,  <e1> desmoplakin </e1> ,  <e2> elafin </e2> , keratins, members of the small proline-rich superfamily, loricrin, and unknown proteins related to the desmoplakin family
