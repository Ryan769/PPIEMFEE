False	The very much lower affinity of  <e1> profilin </e1>  for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of  <e2> profilin </e2>  and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.
False	A null mutation of the actin gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the  <e1> tropomyosin </e1>  (TPM1), fimbrin (SAC6), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein ( <e2> CAP1 </e2>  and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.

False	The core  <e1> histones </e1>  from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of  <e2> histone </e2>  H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	RAD51,  <e1> RAD54 </e1> ,  <e2> RAD55 </e2>  and RAD57 are still required when the same transcribed donor is on the chromosome.
False	alpha- and  <e1> beta-c <e2> atenin </e1>  </e2>  were present in most ovarian cells at all stages of folliculogenesis.
True	Unlike  <e1> fimbrin </e1> , L-plastin's  <e2> actin </e2> -bundling action was strictly calcium-dependent: the bundles were formed at pCa 7, but not at pCa 6.
False	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase ( <e1> PNR </e1> ), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), histone H1, histone H2A + 2B,  <e2> histone </e2>  H3, and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.

False	A reconstitution is described that requires not only the growth factor, its receptor with  <e1> tyrosine kinase </e1>  activity, and the soluble phospholipase C-gamma 1, but also the small soluble  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2>  profilin.
False	Because  <e1> histone </e1>  H3 shares many structural features with histone H4 and is intimately associated with  <e2> H4 </e2>  in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether H3 has similar functions.
True	In reconstitution experiments,  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments incubated in EGTA with purified fimbrin and  <e2> villin </e2>  form smooth-sided bundles containing an apparently random number of filaments.

False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human  <e1> profilins </e1>  rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba  <e2> profilin-I </e2>  has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.
False	Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  and vice versa.
False	The undifferentiated cells (a) were unable to spread on gelatin or laminin and grew as rounded colonies, although they were able to spread on fibronectin (b) showed reduced adhesion to laminin, but not fibronectin (c) expressed much reduced levels of beta1 integrin, although levels of alpha5 and alphaV were wild-type (d) were less polarized with increased membrane protrusions compared with a  <e1> vinculin </e1>  (-/-) ES cell mutant (e) were unable to assemble vinculin or paxillin-containing focal adhesions or  <e2> actin </e2>  stress fibers on fibronectin, whereas vinculin (-/-) ES cells were able to assemble talin-containing focal adhesions.
False	In these investigations, we determine that recruitment of a coactivator protein,  <e1> CBP </e1>  (the CREBbinding protein), to the CYBB or NCF2 promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by PU.1, IRF1, and  <e2> ICSBP </e2> .

False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b- <e1> M </e1> -G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function;  <e2> M </e2>  is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55,  <e1> SRV2 </e1> ,  <e2> TPM1 </e2> , SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified  <e1> acetylase </e1> ,  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	Here we describe the TNF-dependent activation of  <e1> acid SMase </e1>  (A-SMase) through the  <e2> p55 </e2>  TNF receptor-associated proteins TRADD and FADD.

True	N-formyl peptide chemoattractants in neutrophils stimulate the formation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a reservoir for second messenger molecules and regulator of  <e1> actin </e1>  assembly through its association with the actin-binding proteins,  <e2> profilin </e2> , and gelsolin.
False	Archaeal  <e1> histones </e1>  are most similar to the globular histone fold region of eukaryal histone H4, and the results reported are consistent with archaeal nucleosomes resembling the structure formed by eukaryal histone (H3+ <e2> H4 </e2> )2tetramers.

False	The neoplastic cells were positive for  <e1> vimentin </e1> , Factor-XIIIa, alpha-smooth muscle actin and CD34, but negative for desmin, calponin, high molecular weight caldesmon, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain,  <e2> collagen type IV </e2> , laminin and S-100 protein.
True	We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much  <e1> profilin </e1>  is bound to its known ligands: actin, membrane PIP(2),  <e2> Arp2 </e2> /3 complex and polyproline sequences.
True	At the light microscope level, brush cells can be identified by antibodies against the  <e1> actin </e1>  filament crosslinking proteins  <e2> villin </e2>  and fimbrin that not only stain the apical tuft of microvilli and their rootlets, but also label projections emanating from the basolateral surface of these cells.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone  <e1> H2A.X </e1> , histone H2A.Z, histone H2B, three  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 variants and histone H4.
False	The sizes and characteristics of each of the proteins determined from various radiolabelling experiments allowed preliminary identification of the proteins as the large (L; 190 kDa), haemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN; 74 kDa), nucleocapsid ( <e1> N </e1> ; 66 kDa), fusion (F0; 63 kDa), phosphoprotein ( <e2> P </e2> ; 49 kDa), matrix (M; 43 kDa) and non-structural (V; 35 kDa) proteins.

True	The results indicate that (a) plakoglobin and beta-catenin differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with LEF-1 and vinculin; (b) LEF-1-dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by beta-catenin; and (c) the cytoplasmic partners of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , cadherin and  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , can sequester it to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity.
True	In normal livers, E-cad,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  and beta-catenin, but not CD44s, CD44v5,  <e2> CD44v6 </e2> , CD44v7-8, and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts.
False	The genes considered are those for 5S, 5.8S and  <e1> 18S r <e2> RNA </e1>  </e2> , actin I, profilins Ia/b and II, myosins IB, IC and II, and calmodulin.
False	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in  <e2> cyclin E-associated kinase </e2>  activity.
False	A further outcome of this study is that the actin filament core bundles in microvilli of chicken pigment epithelial cells are presumed to contain a crosslinking protein, which is not immunologically related to either villin,  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  or  <e2> myosin I </e2>  of the intestinal brush border.

False	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of ActA binds one  <e1> actin </e1>  monomer, in a profilin-like fashion, and Arp2/3 complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of WASp family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by Arp2/ <e2> 3 </e2>  complex.
False	Profilin II binds actin with a similar affinity to that of  <e1> profilin I </e1> , although it inhibits  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization more strongly than profilin I under non-equilibrium conditions.
True	The common denominator is impaired  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  association with either  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  (PaTuII) or alpha-catenin (BxPc3 and T3M4).
True	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD, DR3,  <e1> FAF </e1> , TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to  <e2> TNFalpha </e2> -induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
True	Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the  <e1> EGFR </e1>   <e2> tyrosine kinase </e2> , whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not.
False	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative PCAF substrates, histones  <e1> H3 </e1>  and H4 and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that histone H3 is significantly preferred over the histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  and p53 substrates.
False	Resonance energy transfer determination of the following distances, using a hybrid myosin: those between Cys-55 on the Mercenaria regulatory light chain, SH-1 on the Aequipecten  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1> , and Cys-374 of  <e2> actin </e2> .

False	WASp contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase CDC42Hs as well as  <e1> verprolin </e1> /cofilin-like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific  <e2> actin </e2>  structure regulated by CDC42Hs-WASp has been identified.
False	These genes were designated UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> , UL9,  <e2> UL42 </e2> , and UL52 and were predicted to encode proteins with molecular weights of, respectively, 99,000, 80,000, 94,000, 51,000, and 114,000.
False	We show that the HSV-1 UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> , UL29, UL30, UL42, and UL52 gene products along with the AAV  <e2> Rep68 </e2>  protein are sufficient to initiate replication on duplex DNA containing the AAV origins of replication, resulting in products several hundred nucleotides in length.

True	Moreover, ectopic expression of  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1>  and Cdk4 can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the  <e2> p16 </e2> (INK4a) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.

False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin, APC, and  <e1> Tcf-4 </e1> , which bind to the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.

False	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the  <e1> cadherin </e1> ; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/ <e2> catenin </e2>  complex to the actin cytoskeleton.
False	We conclude that germ-line involvement of MSH6 and  <e1> MSH3 </e1>  is rare and that other genes are likely to account for a majority of MSH2-,  <e2> MLH1 </e2> -mutation negative families with nonpolypotic colon cancer.

True	Tyrosine phosphorylation of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor ( <e2> EGFR </e2> ) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin.
True	One mutation, sac6-69, is in the gene encoding  <e1> fimbrin </e1> , another  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2> , which was expected because null mutations in SAC6 and CAP2 are known to be synthetic-lethal.

False	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous myogenin and myosin light chain 2 gene but not the endogenous MyoD1, MRF4,  <e1> Myf5 </e1> , the skeletal muscle actin, or the  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  genes.

False	We find that heterozygotes for  <e1> actin </e1>  (Act88F) or myosin heavy chain ( <e2> Mhc36B </e2> ) null alleles have complex myofibrillar defects, whereas Mhc36B-/+; Act88F-/+ double heterozygotes have nearly normal myofibrils.

False	In the  <e1> ADE2 </e1>  assay system, silencing depends completely upon the function of the SIR genes, known trans-acting regulators of the silent loci, and is sensitive to the gene dosage of two  <e2> SIR </e2>  genes, SIR1 and SIR4.

False	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of ActA binds one actin monomer, in a profilin-like fashion, and Arp2/3 complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of  <e1> WASp </e1>  family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by Arp2/ <e2> 3 </e2>  complex.

False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large  <e1> protein </e1>  (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210,  <e2> L </e2> : 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.
False	 <e1> Actophorin </e1>  and profilin have opposite effects on the rate of exchange of nucleotide bound to  <e2> actin </e2>  monomers.

False	The  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton-associated protein talin binds to  <e2> integrins </e2> , vinculin, and actin.
False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein (NP) and phosphoprotein ( <e1> P </e1> ) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein ( <e2> M </e2> ) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.
True	Testicular protein kinase 1 ( <e1> TESK1 </e1> ) is a  <e2> serine/threonine kinase </e2>  highly expressed in testicular germ cells and has the potential to phosphorylate cofilin and induce actin cytoskeletal reorganization.

False	The  <e1> p120cas </e1>  gene encodes a protein tyrosine kinase substrate that associates with the cell-cell adhesion protein complex containing  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  and its cytoplasmic cofactors alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and plakoglobin.
True	The cytoplasmic domain of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , whereas the binding of gamma-catenin (plakoglobin) to E-cadherin is less efficient.
False	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),  <e1> ribonucleotide reductase </e1>  (PNR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), histone  <e2> H1 </e2> , histone H2A + 2B, histone H3, and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.

True	These data indicate that the  <e1> actin </e1> -binding domains in plant and animal  <e2> profilins </e2>  are functionally highly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity is less than 25%.
True	The NH2-terminal 16kD of  <e1> Abp1p </e1> , a 65-kD yeast protein identified by its ability to bind to actin filaments, is 23% identical to yeast  <e2> cofilin </e2> .

False	Transfection of alpha-catenin-deficient colon carcinoma cells recruited  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  to cell-cell contacts and functional cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion was restored in this way.
True	Together these results indicate that  <e1> TGFbeta </e1>  regulates clusterin gene expression through an  <e2> AP-1 </e2>  site and its cognate transcription factor AP-1, and requires the involvement of protein kinase C.
True	Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 can stimulate the  <e1> Brca1 </e1>  promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the  <e2> p16 </e2> (INK4a) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.
False	Immunofluorescence microscopy of cells grown on  <e1> fibronectin </e1>  confirmed the presence of paxillin,  <e2> talin </e2> , and vinculin at the ends of actin stress fibers at presumptive focal contacts in melanocytes.

False	One, MORT1 (also called FADD), binds to Fas/APO1 but not to p55-R; another, TRADD, binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to Fas/ <e1> APO1 </e1> ; and the third,  <e2> RIP </e2> , binds weakly to both receptors.
False	Since alpha-catenin is required for  <e1> cadherin </e1> -mediated adhesion, the  <e2> armadillo </e2>  repeat region alone probably cannot promote cell adhesion, making it unlikely that beta-catenin induces axis duplication by increasing cell adhesion.
False	WASp contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase CDC42Hs as well as verprolin/ <e1> cofilin </e1> -like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific actin structure regulated by  <e2> CDC42Hs </e2> -WASp has been identified.
False	Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of thymosin beta(4) (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between actin and  <e1> thymosin beta(4) </e1> , and explain why thymosin beta(4) and  <e2> profilin </e2>  can bind simultaneously to actin.
False	In investigating the mechanism by which  <e1> pRb </e1>  induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to  <e2> cyclin E </e2>  and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.
True	Analyses of beta-catenin or E-cadherin immunoprecipitates from BMMC lysate revealed that alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin were co-precipitated, suggesting that  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  and  <e2> catenins </e2>  form a complex in mast cells.
False	We have characterized this actin with respect to its ability to interact with yeast  <e1> profilin </e1>  and  <e2> tropomyosin </e2> , the only yeast actin-binding proteins so far purified and characterized.

True	In contrast,  <e1> act1-159 </e1>  partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in fimbrin, Mdm20p, and  <e2> tropomyosin </e2>  null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these actin-binding proteins.
False	Lack of detection in these preparations of a constituent that binds RBC  <e1> alpha-spectrin </e1>  antibody plus the presence of significant quantities of  <e2> actin </e2> , further suggests that the principal membrane skeletal element is actin with perhaps smaller quantities of a 240-kd component, identified by others as the protein talin.
False	Armadillo (Arm) repeat 10 to the COOH terminus of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  is involved in binding to CBP, whereas beta-catenin interacts directly with the CREB-binding domain of  <e2> CBP </e2> .
False	The 16236 nt genome encodes eight proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP),  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  (P), V protein, matrix protein ( <e2> M </e2> ), fusion protein (F), small hydrophobic (SH) protein, haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein and large (L) protein, which are flanked by a 55 nt leader sequence and a 54 nt trailer sequence.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1,  <e1> WHI3 </e1> , NAB1,  <e2> DBR1 </e2> , CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.

True	The  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  (P) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotypes New Jersey [P(NJ)] and Indiana [P(I)] contains a highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain which is required for binding to the cognate N-RNA template as well as to form a soluble complex with the nucleocapsid protein  <e2> N </e2>  in vivo.
False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of  <e1> FLICE </e1> , Fas, FADD, DR3, FAF, TRADD, and  <e2> RIP </e2>  was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
False	Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent analog of  <e1> actin </e1>  with a high affinity for profilin revealed that it incorporated into cortical cytoplasmic fibers and was also distributed diffusely in the non-cortical cytoplasm consistent with a bias of  <e2> actin </e2>  assembly near the surface of the cell.
False	Immunohistochemistry for a variety of cytokeratins ( <e1> CKs </e1> ) (8/ <e2> 18 </e2> , 1/10, 7, and 20), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, vimentin CD34, type IV collagen, smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and glial fibrillary acid protein was performed.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A,  <e1> H2B </e1> , H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of  <e2> histone </e2>  H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	METHODS: Tumor samples from 77 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were immunohistochemically evaluated for the expression of 10 molecules: the cell cycle-related molecules of cyclin D1,  <e1> Rb </e1> , p16INK4, p27KIP1, and PCNA; the cell-cell adhesion molecules of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> ; and the heat shock proteins of HSP27 and HSP70.
True	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that  <e1> vinculin </e1>  has a negligible influence on internal  <e2> actin </e2>  filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with talin, another actin and vinculin-binding protein from focal adhesions.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone H2A.X,  <e1> histone </e1>  H2A.Z, histone H2B, three  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 variants and histone H4.
True	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to  <e1> actin binding proteins </e1>  such as gelsolin and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta  <e1> rdh54Delta </e1>  double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the  <e2> srs2 </e2>  rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
False	The C-terminal of  <e1> TRADD </e1>  comprises the "death domain" that is responsible for association of TNFR1 and other death domain-containing proteins such as FADD and  <e2> RIP </e2> .
False	METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections of five AVMs, CCMs, and control brain tissues were stained immunohistochemically with antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA),  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1> , and  <e2> smoothelin </e2> , a novel marker for contractile VSMC phenotype.
True	In vitro studies indicated that suramin completely blocked  <e1> PDGF receptor </e1>  activation or phosphorylation stimulated by  <e2> PDGF-AB </e2> , inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) kinases (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2, and abrogated transcription factor AP-1 DNA-binding activity.

False	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include ERCC1,  <e1> ERCC2 </e1>  (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the  <e2> HHR23B </e2> /p58 and HHR23A subunits of XPC.
False	cDNA clones of the  <e1> N </e1> ,  <e2> P </e2> , and L genes were constructed in pGEM-based expression plasmids and shown to direct expression of the appropriate polypeptides.
False	Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of  <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  to alpha-catenin and vice versa.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M- <e1> G </e1> -L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein  <e2> P </e2>  and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
True	By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled  <e1> profilin </e1>  binds  <e2> Arp2 </e2> /3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for actin monomers.
True	In addition, we also provide new evidence to suggest that  <e1> HRG </e1>  stimulation of the  <e2> EF-1alpha </e2>  promoter involves increased physical interactions with acetylated histone H3 and histone H4.
True	In the present study we show that brush cells can be identified in tissue sections even at the light microscopic level by immunostaining with antibodies against  <e1> villin </e1>  and fimbrin, two proteins that crosslink  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments to form bundles.
False	A null mutation of the actin gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the  <e1> tropomyosin </e1>  (TPM1), fimbrin ( <e2> SAC6 </e2> ), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein (CAP1 and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/ <e1> p300 </e1> , and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/ <e2> waf1 </e2>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest requires the checkpoint control genes RAD9,  <e1> RAD17 </e1> , RAD24, MEC1, MEC2 and  <e2> MEC3 </e2> .
True	 <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  and plakoglobin possibly play more regulatory roles, as it was shown that their tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with modified  <e2> cadherin </e2>  activities.
False	In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, but not CD44s,  <e1> CD44v5 </e1> , CD44v6, CD44v7-8, and  <e2> CD44v10 </e2> , were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts.
False	These results suggest that LIMK2 functions downstream of the Rho- <e1> ROCK </e1>  signalling pathway and plays a role in reorganization of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments and membrane structures, by phosphorylating cofilin/ADF proteins.
False	 <e1> Profilins </e1>  also bind polyphosphoinositides, which can disrupt the profilin-actin complex, and proline-rich ligands which localize profilin to sites requiring extensive  <e2> actin </e2>  filament accumulation.
True	Like  <e1> actin </e1> , the actin-associated proteins filamin, talin and the  <e2> beta 1 integrin subunit </e2>  were also found to accumulate around entering bacteria.
False	Here we describe the TNF-dependent activation of  <e1> acid SMase </e1>  (A-SMase) through the p55  <e2> TNF receptor </e2> -associated proteins TRADD and FADD.
False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin, APC, and Tcf-4, which bind to the armadillo repeats of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , but not by coexpression of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.
False	Using ITP (a substrate for myosin II ATPase) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for  <e1> myosin II heavy-chain kinase </e1>  [ <e2> MHCK </e2> ]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that MHCK was localized at the foci.
False	 <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , but not  <e2> E-cadherin </e2> , p120(cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.
True	The structural homology between  <e1> cofilin </e1>  and  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  segment-1 binding to actin was confirmed experimentally by two types of competitive binding assays.
True	This suggests that dephosphorylation of cofilin and destrin/ <e1> ADF </e1>  by  <e2> TSH </e2>  could be implicated in the disruption of actin-containing stress fibers and in the reorganization of microfilaments induced by this hormone.
False	For example, it is associated with  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  (Armadillo), and protected from trypsin digestion only in the presence of Ca2+, as is the case for many of classic cadherins.
False	METHODS: We have performed a detailed study of the pattern of expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC), myosin light chain (MLC), troponin I (TnI) isoforms, connexin 43 (Cx43),  <e1> desmin </e1>  and  <e2> alpha-smooth muscle actin </e2>  (alpha-SMA), in the ventricular conduction system of normal and congenitally malformed mouse hearts (iv background) from embryonic day 14.5 to 19.5.

True	Newly disclosed interactions between  <e1> gephyrin </e1> , exchange factors for G proteins of the Rho and Rac families, the translational regulator  <e2> RAFT1 </e2> , and actin-binding proteins like profilin might integrate activity-dependent and trophic-factor-mediated signals at developing postsynaptic sites.
True	Neuropilin 1 ( <e1> NP-1 </e1> ) is a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  <e2> 165 </e2>  (VEGF165) and acts as a coreceptor that enhances VEGF165 function through tyrosine kinase VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2).
True	The Arp2/3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin, consists of seven polypeptides; two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3; and five apparently novel proteins,  <e1> p40 </e1> , p35, p19, p18, and  <e2> p14 </e2>  (Machesky et al., 1994).

False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of  <e1> platelet actin </e1>  much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <e2> actin </e2>  with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	Because other researchers have shown that the  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  and RAD52 proteins interact, RAD51 on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the rad52-20 allele, but RAD 54,  <e2> 55 </e2>  and 57 did not suppress.
False	Analysis of changes in state suggests that  <e1> SIR1 </e1>  protein has a role in the establishment but not the maintenance of repression of silent mating type genes, whereas SIR2,  <e2> SIR3 </e2> , and SIR4 are required for maintenance.

False	Electrical stimulation of cardiocyte contraction did not enhance  <e1> alpha-cardiac actin </e1>  or myosin heavy chain (alpha+ <e2> beta </e2> ) mRNA transcript levels relative to 28S rRNA during the period of rapid growth that occurred over the first 48 hours.
False	Previous studies have yielded conflicting results concerning the physiological role of profilin, a 12-15-kD  <e1> actin </e1> - and phosphoinositide-binding protein, as a regulator of  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or  <e1> MPK1 </e1>  (MAP kinase) mimicked  <e2> PKC1 </e2>  as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts  <e1> actin </e1>  stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal  <e2> actin </e2>  binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.

True	Inhibition of  <e1> actomyosin </e1>  subfragment 1 ATPase activity by analog peptides of the actin-binding site around the Cys(SH1) of  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2> .
False	The neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, Factor-XIIIa, alpha-smooth muscle actin and CD34, but negative for desmin, calponin,  <e1> high molecular weight caldesmon </e1> , smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, collagen type IV, laminin and  <e2> S-100 </e2>  protein.
False	Although  <e1> profilin </e1>  released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of  <e2> actin </e2>  released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
False	Expression of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> ,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  and beta-catenin in normal ovarian surface epithelium and epithelial ovarian cancers.
False	beta-catenin or  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  is associated directly with the cadherin;  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

False	The core histones from Physarum,  <e1> histones </e1>  H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of  <e2> histone </e2>  H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	One mutation,  <e1> sac6-69 </e1> , is in the gene encoding fimbrin, another actin-binding protein, which was expected because null mutations in  <e2> SAC6 </e2>  and CAP2 are known to be synthetic-lethal.
False	In this study the role of  <e1> MSH2 </e1> , MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2,  <e2> msh3 </e2> , and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins.

True	In the ADE2 assay system, silencing depends completely upon the function of the SIR genes, known trans-acting regulators of the silent loci, and is sensitive to the gene dosage of two  <e1> SIR </e1>  genes,  <e2> SIR1 </e2>  and SIR4.

True	The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  will independently associate with  <e2> APC </e2> , although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin.

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous  <e2> acetylase(s) </e2> .

True	The interaction between calf  <e1> spleen profilin </e1>  and actin depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the  <e2> actin </e2> , and in the case of profilin, the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.

False	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p21 </e1> (WAF1/ <e2> CIP1 </e2> ) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol) delta in the conversion reaction.
True	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and  <e1> alpha 1-syntrophin </e1>  interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/ <e2> dystrophin related protein </e2> , and the Torpedo 87K protein.

False	These observations demonstrate that cardiac development in man, in contrast to rodent heart, is characterized by an up-regulation of the  <e1> skeletal actin </e1>  gene, the expression of which does not change in hypertrophied and failing hearts, and suggest that the actin and  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  families are independently regulated in human heart.
False	The cytoplasmic domain of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with beta-catenin, whereas the binding of  <e2> gamma-catenin </e2>  (plakoglobin) to E-cadherin is less efficient.

False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that  <e1> CBP </e1> /p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/ <e2> waf1 </e2>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	The 16236 nt genome encodes eight proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein ( <e1> P </e1> ), V protein, matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), small hydrophobic (SH) protein, haemagglutinin-neuraminidase ( <e2> HN </e2> ) protein and large (L) protein, which are flanked by a 55 nt leader sequence and a 54 nt trailer sequence.

False	The Tetrahymena  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  has two actin-binding domains, but lacks the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding motif, suggesting that Tetrahymena  <e2> fimbrin </e2>  probably cross-links actin filaments in a Ca(2+)- insensitive manner during cytokinesis.

True	As previous studies indicated that the  <e1> RVS161 </e1>  and  <e2> RVS167 </e2>  gene products of Saccharomyces cerevisiae seem to be involved in the same cellular function, we considered the possibility of a complex between the proteins encoded by these two genes.
False	Such motifs are known to bind to  <e1> profilins </e1>  ( <e2> PFNs </e2> ), small proteins engaged in the control of actin dynamics.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via  <e1> p38 </e1>  MAPK, may be involved in the  <e2> muscarinic receptor </e2> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
True	The  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  (P) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotypes New Jersey [P(NJ)] and Indiana [ <e2> P(I) </e2> ] contains a highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain which is required for binding to the cognate N-RNA template as well as to form a soluble complex with the nucleocapsid protein N in vivo.
False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native  <e1> profilins </e1> ; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native  <e2> profilin-I </e2> ; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.
False	The cytoplasmic domain of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with beta-catenin, whereas the binding of gamma-catenin (plakoglobin) to  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  is less efficient.

True	We report here that tropomyosin, which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the villin and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect  <e1> actin </e1>  binding by 110-kD  <e2> calmodulin </e2> .

True	ActA appears to control at least four functions that collectively lead to  <e1> actin </e1> -based motility: (1) initiation of  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization, (2) polarization of ActA function, (3) transformation of actin polymerization into a motile force and (4) acceleration of movement mediated by the host protein profilin.
False	We used yeast as a model to test this hypothesis and found that chromosome deletion of any known nuclear mitotic mismatch repair genes, including  <e1> MLH1 </e1> , MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and  <e2> PMS1 </e2> , did not rescue mgt1delta O6 MeG DNA repair methyltransferase-deficient cells from killing by MNNG.
True	The exogeneous cofilin, but not  <e1> ADF </e1> , caused quick disassembly of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments and accumulated in furrow region of dividing cells.

False	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified  <e1> actin </e1>  explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled  <e2> actin </e2> .

False	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and  <e1> PIP kinases </e1>  and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  and profilin.
False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains  <e1> nucleocapsid protein </e1>  ( <e2> NP </e2> ) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein (M) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.
False	 <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , but not E-cadherin, p120(cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was  <e2> histone </e2>  H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with  <e1> E2A </e1>  in up-regulation of  <e2> p21 </e2> /waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2,  <e1> RHO2 </e1> , HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and  <e2> MID2 </e2>  also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.

True	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other:  <e1> profilin </e1>  has different effects on elongation at the two ends of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.

False	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by  <e1> profilin </e1>  of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled  <e2> actin </e2> .

False	Sequences upstream of the coding region for RAD51 protein share homology with the damage response sequence element of  <e1> RAD54 </e1> , an upstream activating sequence required for damage regulation of the RAD54 transcript, and also contain two sites for restriction enzyme MluI; the presence of  <e2> MluI </e2>  restriction sites has been associated with cell cycle regulation.

False	These results show that the C-terminal  <e1> actin </e1> -binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody  <e2> TD77 </e2> , raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the talin molecule.
True	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like  <e1> beta 1-syntrophin </e1> , both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of  <e2> dystrophin </e2> , utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.

False	Because other researchers have shown that the RAD51 and RAD52 proteins interact, RAD51 on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the  <e1> rad52-20 </e1>  allele, but  <e2> RAD 54 </e2> , 55 and 57 did not suppress.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone  <e1> H1 </e1>  subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone H2A.X, histone H2A.Z, histone H2B, three histone H3 variants and histone  <e2> H4 </e2> .

True	 <e1> Aprotinin </e1>  inhibited platelet aggregation induced by thrombin (0.25 U.ml-1) with IC50 200 kIU.ml-1, and inhibited the rise of cytosolic free calcium concentration in platelets stimulated by  <e2> thrombin </e2>  (0.1 U.ml-1) in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+ 0.5 mmol.L-1 (IC50 117 and 50 kIU.ml-1, respectively), but had no effect on the amounts of actin and myosin heavy chain associated with cytoskeletons.

False	The core histones from Physarum, histones  <e1> H2A </e1> , H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule);  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	Treatment with HNE resulted in activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases  <e1> ERK1 </e1>  and ERK2, induction of c-fos and c-jun protein expression, and an increase in transcription factor  <e2> AP-1 </e2>  DNA binding activity.
True	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of  <e1> MSH2 </e1> -dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and  <e2> MSH3 </e2> .
True	 <e1> MSH3 </e1>  appears to be more closely related to the mouse  <e2> Rep-3 </e2>  gene and other similar eukaryotic mutS homologues than to the yeast gene MSH2 and other mutS homologues that are involved in replication repair.

False	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of  <e1> cyclin E-dependent kinase </e1>  activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( <e2> CKI </e2> ).
False	From these observations it is concluded that (i)  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that RAD51 and RAD52 have different functions, or that  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  has functions in addition to those of the Rad51/Rad52 protein complex.

False	Because other researchers have shown that the RAD51 and  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  proteins interact,  <e2> RAD51 </e2>  on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the rad52-20 allele, but RAD 54, 55 and 57 did not suppress.

False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of  <e1> N-cadherin </e1> , APC, and Tcf-4, which bind to the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  in the nucleus.
True	Thus, APC forms distinct heteromeric complexes containing combinations of  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , beta-catenin, and  <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  which are independent from the cadherin-catenin complexes.
False	Fusiform RPE, however, were not deficient in these proteins, expressing amounts of  <e1> N-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin, beta-catenin,  <e2> plakoglobin </e2> , p120, alpha-actinin and vinculin that were equivalent to epithelioid cells.

False	Inhibition of  <e1> actin </e1>  polymerization in KCl was stronger than that of the parental profilin, and the Kd value of its interaction with rabbit skeletal muscle actin, as determined by falling ball viscometry, was smaller (mean value 0.5 x 10(-6) M, as compared to 1.9 x 10(-6) M for bovine  <e2> profilin </e2> ).
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of  <e1> Rho </e1>  activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to  <e2> actin binding proteins </e2>  such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	We find that heterozygotes for  <e1> actin </e1>  ( <e2> Act88F </e2> ) or myosin heavy chain (Mhc36B) null alleles have complex myofibrillar defects, whereas Mhc36B-/+; Act88F-/+ double heterozygotes have nearly normal myofibrils.

False	Silencing mediated by GBD-SIR1 requires the trans-acting factors that normally participate in repression, namely,  <e1> SIR2 </e1> , SIR3, SIR4, and  <e2> histone </e2>  H4.
False	The core  <e1> histones </e1>  from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.

False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions  <e1> RAD9 </e1> , RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2  <e2> rad54 </e2>  and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
True	We report here that LIMK1 and  <e1> LIMK2 </e1>  phosphorylate both cofilin and  <e2> actin-depolymerizing factor </e2>  (ADF) specifically at Ser-3 and exhibit partially distinct substrate specificity when tested using site-directed cofilin mutants as substrates.

False	Results from epistasis analyses indicate that MSH2 functions in mismatch repair in conjunction with  <e1> MSH3 </e1>  or MSH6 and that  <e2> MSH3 </e2>  and MSH6 constitute alternate pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair.
False	From an analysis of  <e1> profilin </e1>  mutants, whose actin cytoskeleton is disrupted, we found that  <e2> E-APC </e2>  also requires actin filaments to associate with adhesive cell membranes in the ovary.
False	Even the  <e1> Munc18-2 </e1>  mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the  <e2> syntaxin </e2>  interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment.

False	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified  <e1> actin </e1>  explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by  <e2> profilin </e2>  of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.
False	Our data indicate that even  <e1> profilins </e1>  of highly distant evolutionary origin can functionally substitute for each other and support the hypothesis that in animal cells, profilins are engaged in regulating either the stability or the kinetic properties of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5,  <e1> DPB11 </e1> , MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17,  <e2> RAD24 </e2> , BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.

True	However, some proteins (e.g.,  <e1> profilin </e1> ) and other agents (e.g., cytochalasin D) that bind to actin are affected by the presence of fluorescent labels, making actin intrinsic fluorescence potentially useful in investigating the interaction of these agents with  <e2> actin </e2> , and in validating data obtained using labeled actin.
False	However, increases were also selective in nature, with increases in certain individual proteins, including  <e1> actin </e1>  (twofold to threefold), vimentin (2.5-fold to sevenfold),  <e2> tropomyosin </e2>  (threefold to sixfold), and myosin heavy chain, far exceeding overall increases in cellular protein content (20-40%).

True	Gravin is not likely to be a nonerythroid spectrin,  <e1> talin </e1> , myosin, or actin-binding protein based on the lack of reactivity of  <e2> antigravin </e2>  with these polypeptides in immunoblots.

False	The  <e1> APC </e1>  binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> .
False	Because beta-catenin is known to interact with  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , which binds to actin, we generated a fusion molecule consisting of the ectodomain of E-cadherin and the actin binding site of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> .
False	In vitro studies indicated that suramin completely blocked PDGF receptor activation or phosphorylation stimulated by PDGF-AB, inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK)  <e1> kinases </e1>  (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2, and abrogated transcription factor  <e2> AP-1 </e2>  DNA-binding activity.
False	In this study the role of MSH2,  <e1> MSH3 </e1> , and  <e2> MSH6 </e2>  in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins.

True	As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of profilin promote extensive  <e1> actin </e1>  assembly off of the pool of  <e2> actin </e2> -T beta 4 complex.
False	Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a 130-kDa transmembrane receptor for semaphorins, mediators of neuronal guidance, and for  <e1> vascular endothelial growth factor 165 </e1>  ( <e2> VEGF(165) </e2> ), an angiogenesis factor.
False	However, disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton using Latrunculin-A does not alter  <e1> verprolin </e1> 's location, indicating that verprolin establishes and maintains its location independent of the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1,  <e1> PDS1 </e1> , and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24,  <e2> BUB3 </e2> , and MAD3 had little effect.

False	However, some proteins (e.g., profilin) and other agents (e.g., cytochalasin D) that bind to  <e1> actin </e1>  are affected by the presence of fluorescent labels, making actin intrinsic fluorescence potentially useful in investigating the interaction of these agents with actin, and in validating data obtained using labeled  <e2> actin </e2> .
True	Transcriptional expression of  <e1> TNFR1 </e1> (p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD, DR3, FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to  <e2> TNFalpha </e2> -induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

False	Yeast profilin can sequester yeast  <e1> actin </e1>  monomers and thereby reduce the ability of yeast  <e2> actin </e2>  to polymerize, whereas it has little effect on the degree of polymerization of rabbit skeletal muscle actin.
False	The Arp2/3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin, consists of seven polypeptides; two  <e1> actin </e1> -related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3; and five apparently novel proteins, p40, p35, p19,  <e2> p18 </e2> , and p14 (Machesky et al., 1994).

False	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of  <e1> p27 </e1>  with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to  <e2> cyclin E </e2> /CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).
False	BACKGROUND: p27(Kip1), a  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1> , negatively regulates the G1 phase progression of the cell cycle by binding to the  <e2> cyclin E </e2> /cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complex.
False	Moreover, ectopic expression of  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1>  and Cdk4 can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an  <e2> E2F </e2> -dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the p16(INK4a) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.

False	In their cytoplasmic region, some of these receptors share a conserved sequence motif - the 'death domain' - which is required for transduction of the apoptotic signal by recruiting other death-domain-containing adaptor molecules like the Fas-associated protein FADD/ <e1> MORT1 </e1>  or the  <e2> TNF receptor </e2> -associated protein TRADD [2-4].
False	In invasive ductal carcinomas,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  was reduced more frequently in diffuse than in solid type tumours, whereas the level of expression of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  and E-CD was unchanged between them.
True	The involvement of the death adaptor proteins FADD/MORT1, TRADD, and  <e1> RIP </e1>  and the apoptosis-initiating caspases-8 and -10 in death signaling by the two death-inducing  <e2> TRAIL receptors 1 </e2>  and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) are controversial.

True	The higher affinity of vaccinia  <e1> profilin </e1>  for polyphosphoinositides (Kd = 0.2-8.5 microM) than for  <e2> actin </e2>  or poly(L-proline) and the concentration of vaccinia profilin expressed in infected HeLa cells (approximately 20 microM) suggest that vaccinia profilin binds preferentially to PIP and PIP2 in vivo.
False	Stable transfection of mutant plakoglobin molecules showed that deletion of the N-cadherin binding domain, but not the  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  binding domain, abolished  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  downregulation.

False	Several lines of evidence show that the  <e1> profilins </e1>  fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization.

False	Thus, both  <e1> DR5 </e1>  and  <e2> DR4 </e2>  use FADD, TRADD, and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and FADD is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.

True	Although both receptors are involved in M21 and H2981 cell adhesion to  <e1> vitronectin </e1> , only a alpha v beta 3 can be detected in focal contacts, colocalizing with vinculin, talin, and the ends of actin filaments, while  <e2> alpha v beta 5 </e2>  shows a distinct, nonfocal contact, distribution on the cell surface.
False	The  <e1> APC </e1>  binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with  <e2> APC </e2> , although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin.

False	beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, p120(cas) or  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .
True	The main inhibitory action of p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), arises from its binding with the  <e1> cyclin E </e1> / <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase 2 </e2>  (Cdk2) complex that results in G(1)-S arrest.

False	Two isoforms of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIB ( <e1> MHC-IIB </e1> ) are generated by alternative splicing; MHC-IIB(B2) differs from MHC-IIB(DeltaB2) by the insertion of B2 exon cassette near the  <e2> actin </e2>  binding region.

False	The centrifugation assay and the  <e1> DNase I </e1>  inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.
True	Sequences upstream of the coding region for  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  protein share homology with the damage response sequence element of RAD54, an upstream activating sequence required for damage regulation of the RAD54 transcript, and also contain two sites for restriction enzyme  <e2> MluI </e2> ; the presence of MluI restriction sites has been associated with cell cycle regulation.
False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein ( <e1> NP </e1> ) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein (M) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and  <e2> hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein </e2>  (HN) gene sequences.

True	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the amino terminus of alpha-catenin 57-264 behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  binding disrupts the  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  dimer.

True	In cultured cells, cofilin, as well as  <e1> ADF </e1> , translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus together with  <e2> actin </e2>  and forms rod-like structures in response to heat shock or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment.
True	While  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  has been demonstrated to be crucial for  <e2> cadherin </e2>  function, the role of beta-catenin is not yet fully understood.
False	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of ActA binds one actin monomer, in a  <e1> profilin </e1> -like fashion, and Arp2/3 complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of WASp family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by Arp2/ <e2> 3 </e2>  complex.
False	In their cytoplasmic region, some of these receptors share a conserved sequence motif - the 'death domain' - which is required for transduction of the apoptotic signal by recruiting other death-domain-containing adaptor molecules like the Fas-associated protein  <e1> FADD </e1> /MORT1 or the  <e2> TNF receptor </e2> -associated protein TRADD [2-4].
False	We found that the down-regulation of  <e1> E-cad </e1> , alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.
False	 <e1> HGF </e1> /SF treatment of LoVo reduced the amount of alpha-catenin complexed with E-cadherin more markedly than in L-10, but in both cell lines this reduction was not accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , suggesting the presence of a mechanism other than phosphorylation for release from cell-cell adhesion during cell motility.
False	Quantitation of the appearance of  <e1> X22 </e1>  banding in primary cultures of myotubes indicates that it precedes that of other myofibrillar proteins and that assembly takes place in the following order: X22,  <e2> titin </e2> , myosin heavy chain, actin, and desmin.

True	Class II profilins had higher affinity for poly-l-proline and sequestered more monomeric  <e1> actin </e1>  than did  <e2> class I profilins </e2> .
False	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous myogenin and  <e1> myosin light chain 2 </e1>  gene but not the endogenous MyoD1, MRF4, Myf5, the skeletal muscle actin, or the  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  genes.

False	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  linked to the amino terminus of alpha-catenin 57-264 behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since beta-catenin binding disrupts the  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  dimer.
False	The APC binding site on  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> .
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of  <e1> histone </e1>  H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was  <e2> histone </e2>  H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

False	Immunoprecipitation with an E-cadherin mAb, which is known to co-precipitate the  <e1> catenins </e1> , demonstrated that the three poorly differentiated cell lines expressing  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  did not co-precipitate alpha-catenin, although all of the moderately-well differentiated cell lines expressed both alpha- and beta-catenin.
True	Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  with  <e2> EGFR </e2>  were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not.

True	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of  <e1> profilin </e1>  in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized  <e2> actin </e2>  content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.

False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of  <e1> PLC-delta </e1> , which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
True	Thus, it is most likely that the association between  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  and alpha-catenin is mediated by  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in beta-catenin.

False	In investigating the mechanism by which  <e1> pRb </e1>  induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27( <e2> KIP1 </e2> ) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.
False	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and  <e1> PIP k <e2> inases </e1>  </e2>  and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.

False	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled  <e1> actin </e1>  in the presence of  <e2> profilin </e2>  and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.

False	P-cadherin expression is a better indicator of clinical outcome than alterations in the expression of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , N-cadherin,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , or beta-catenin.
False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix ( <e1> M </e1> ), fusion (F), and large  <e2> protein </e2>  (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210, L: 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.

False	The findings suggest that  <e1> M1 </e1>  muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ <e2> extracellular signal regulated protein kinase </e2>  and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

False	To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound  <e1> profilin </e1> , a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit  <e2> DNase I </e2> .
False	A null mutation of the actin gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin (TPM1),  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  (SAC6), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein (CAP1 and  <e2> CAP2 </e2> ) genes have relatively mild or no effects.
False	Compared with control and contralateral kidneys, the ligated kidneys displayed a dynamic expression of mRNAs for many apoptosis-related molecules, which included an up to threefold increase for Fas, Fas ligand, TNF-R1, TRAIL, TRADD, RIP, and  <e1> caspase-8 </e1> , and an up to twofold increase for FADD and FAP, but there was little change for  <e2> FAF </e2> .

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 ( <e1> MEKK </e1> ) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 ( <e2> MAP kinase </e2> ) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	We used biochemical fractionation, immunoassays and microscopy of live and fixed Acanthamoeba to determine how much  <e1> profilin </e1>  is bound to its known ligands:  <e2> actin </e2> , membrane PIP(2), Arp2/3 complex and polyproline sequences.

False	Expressions of cyclin E,  <e1> A </e1> , and B1 in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells: not suppressed by  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2>  p21 expression.
False	We have shown that the FH proteins Bni1p and Bnr1p are potential targets of the  <e1> Rho </e1>  family small GTP-binding proteins and bind to an actin-binding protein,  <e2> profilin </e2> , at their proline-rich FH1 domains to regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
True	In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/plakoglobin and with  <e2> alpha-actinin </e2> .

False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A,  <e1> H2B </e1> , H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
True	WASp contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase CDC42Hs as well as verprolin/cofilin-like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific  <e1> actin </e1>  structure regulated by  <e2> CDC42Hs </e2> -WASp has been identified.
False	In this study the role of MSH2,  <e1> MSH3 </e1> , and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the  <e2> MSH3 </e2>  and MSH6 proteins.

False	The sizes and characteristics of each of the proteins determined from various radiolabelling experiments allowed preliminary identification of the proteins as the large (L; 190 kDa), haemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN; 74 kDa), nucleocapsid (N; 66 kDa), fusion (F0; 63 kDa), phosphoprotein (P; 49 kDa), matrix (M; 43 kDa) and non-structural (V; 35 kDa)  <e1> p <e2> roteins </e1>  </e2> .
False	Since  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  is required for cadherin-mediated adhesion, the  <e2> armadillo </e2>  repeat region alone probably cannot promote cell adhesion, making it unlikely that beta-catenin induces axis duplication by increasing cell adhesion.
False	We show that the HSV-1 UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> , UL29, UL30,  <e2> UL42 </e2> , and UL52 gene products along with the AAV Rep68 protein are sufficient to initiate replication on duplex DNA containing the AAV origins of replication, resulting in products several hundred nucleotides in length.

False	The hyperproliferative response observed in the gastric mucosa is secondary to this initial insult and is associated with increased expression of cyclin D1, the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p16ink4a </e1>  and of  <e2> p53 </e2>  and decreased expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1.
True	The Arp2/3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin, consists of seven polypeptides; two actin-related proteins,  <e1> Arp2 </e1>  and Arp3; and five apparently novel proteins, p40, p35,  <e2> p19 </e2> , p18, and p14 (Machesky et al., 1994).
False	Specific interactions between the  <e1> nucleocapsid protein </e1>  ( <e2> N </e2> ) and the phosphoprotein (P) of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) have been investigated using a yeast-based two-hybrid system.
False	This result was supported by a high protein expression of the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p16 in 44% of the tumours with high  <e2> cyclin E </e2>  and low D1 expression, and all immunohistochemical pRB defect tumours showed a high p16 protein level.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant  <e1> BCK1-20 </e1>  mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 ( <e2> MEK </e2> ) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	Recent evidence that profilin inhibits phospholipase C and enhances nucleotide exchange of  <e1> actin </e1>  has led some to question whether  <e2> profilin </e2>  is ever truly an actin monomer sequestering agent.
True	To determine the relationship between cell cycle regulation and differentiation, the spatiotemporal expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors ( <e1> CKIs </e1> )  <e2> p27 </e2>  and p57, and markers of differentiating podocytes in developing human kidneys was investigated by immunohistochemistry.
False	WASp contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase CDC42Hs as well as verprolin/ <e1> cofilin </e1> -like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific actin structure regulated by CDC42Hs- <e2> WASp </e2>  has been identified.

True	The hyperproliferative response observed in the gastric mucosa is secondary to this initial insult and is associated with increased expression of cyclin D1, the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16ink4a and of p53 and decreased expression of the  <e1> cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>   <e2> p27kip1 </e2> .
False	Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind  <e1> syntaxin 3 </e1>  were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the syntaxin interaction is not the sole determinant of  <e2> Sec1 </e2>  protein membrane attachment.

False	The genes considered are those for 5S, 5.8S and 18S rRNA, actin I, profilins Ia/b and  <e1> II </e1> , myosins IB, IC and  <e2> II </e2> , and calmodulin.
True	In this study we demonstrate that histone  <e1> H3 </e1>  and histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  synthesized in young (5 hr) conjugating Tetrahymena are deposited into micronuclei in acetylated forms.
False	Determination of the total  <e1> profilin </e1>  and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of profilin to  <e2> actin </e2>  was 1 to 5.2.

False	These results suggest that TNF-alpha can cause apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells through TNFR1-linked apoptotic factors,  <e1> TRADD </e1> , FADD, and  <e2> FLICE </e2> , and TNF-induced ceramide production may be involved in the pathways.
True	A  <e1> LIMK2 </e1>  mutant with replacement of threonine 505 by valine abolished LIMK2 activities for cofilin phosphorylation and  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeletal changes, whereas replacement by glutamate enhanced the protein kinase activity and stress fiber formation by LIMK2.

False	The recombinant material is similar to authentic  <e1> profilin </e1>  from Acanthamoeba-based on fluorescence monitored urea denaturation, circular dichroism,  <e2> actin </e2> -nucleotide exchange rate and the Kd for rabbit skeletal actin.
False	The AV nodal effects of draflazine, ITU, EHNA, and PD81,723 were reversed by the  <e1> A1 adenosine receptor </e1>  antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline and adenosine deaminase, implicating endogenous adenosine acting at the  <e2> A1 adenosine receptor </e2> .
True	The activation of the c-Raf-1-BxB-ER protein leads to an accumulation of high levels of cyclin D1 protein and a repression of the  <e1> p27Kip1 </e1>   <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2>  under all culture conditions tested.
False	However, disassembly of the  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton using Latrunculin-A does not alter verprolin's location, indicating that  <e2> verprolin </e2>  establishes and maintains its location independent of the actin cytoskeleton.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the  <e1> Pkc1p </e1>  pathway such as ROM2,  <e2> RHO2 </e2> , HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	Yeast  <e1> profilin </e1>  can sequester yeast  <e2> actin </e2>  monomers and thereby reduce the ability of yeast actin to polymerize, whereas it has little effect on the degree of polymerization of rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin, APC, and Tcf-4, which bind to the  <e1> armadillo </e1>  repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  in the nucleus.
True	Selective monoclonal antibodies confirm that most of the  <e1> profilin </e1>  is bound to  <e2> actin </e2> : 65% in extract immunoadsorption assays and 74-89% by fluorescent antibody staining.

False	Adherens junction proteins (N-cadherin,  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, plakoglobin, and  <e2> actin </e2> ) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were localized in the cultures by fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro wound healing was compared.
True	The tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and the  <e1> Fas </e1>  receptor recruit complexes formed by the interactions between  <e2> RIP kinase </e2> , TRADD, FADD and RAIDD - adaptor proteins that contain death domains - which in turn recruit other proteins to initiate signaling [1][2][3][4][5].

False	These results suggest that activation of  <e1> PKC </e1>  precedes the activation of PI and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  and profilin.
False	Because histone H3 shares many structural features with histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  and is intimately associated with  <e2> H4 </e2>  in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether H3 has similar functions.
False	Reduced or absent immunoreactivity in the tumour tissue was seen in 63 (70.0 per cent) for alpha-catenin, in 50 (55.6 per cent) for  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , and in 50 (55.6 per cent) for  <e2> gamma-catenin </e2> .
False	The gene for the human  <e1> CREB binding protein </e1> , the transcriptional coactivator CBP, is included in the RT1 cosmid, and mutations in  <e2> CBP </e2>  have recently been identified in nondeleted RTS patients.
False	The gel point assay using an  <e1> actin </e1>  cross-linking protein and the nucleation assay also suggested that cofilin shortens the  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments and hence increases the filament number.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'- <e1> N </e1> -4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed  <e2> glycoprotein </e2>  gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.

False	Immunoprecipitations showed in both cell lines the presence of two different  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> - catenin complexes, one composed of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, and the other of  <e2> E-cadherin </e2> , alpha-catenin and plakoglobin.
True	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <e1> actin </e1>  with  <e2> profilin </e2>  cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein (NP) and  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein (M) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another,  <e2> F0 </e2>  and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.

False	In cultured cells,  <e1> cofilin </e1> , as well as  <e2> ADF </e2> , translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus together with actin and forms rod-like structures in response to heat shock or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment.
True	When ZmPRO4 was microinjected into plant cells, the effect on  <e1> actin </e1> -dependent nuclear position was significantly more rapid than that of another pollen profilin isoform,  <e2> ZmPRO1 </e2> .
False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1( <e1> p55 </e1> ), as well as that of FLICE, Fas,  <e2> FADD </e2> , DR3, FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
False	The involvement of the death adaptor proteins FADD/MORT1, TRADD, and RIP and the apoptosis-initiating  <e1> caspases-8 </e1>  and  <e2> -10 </e2>  in death signaling by the two death-inducing TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) are controversial.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as  <e1> ROM2 </e1> , RHO2,  <e2> HCS77 </e2> /WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	 <e1> p21 </e1>  (p21WAF1/Cip1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, induces G1 arrest and can inhibit the activity of the  <e2> proliferating cell nuclear antigen </e2>  (PCNA).

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2,  <e1> RHO2 </e1> , HCS77/ <e2> WSC1 </e2> /SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	N-formyl peptide chemoattractants in neutrophils stimulate the formation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a reservoir for second messenger molecules and regulator of actin assembly through its association with the  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1> ,  <e2> profilin </e2> , and gelsolin.
True	Immunofluorescence staining of a wild-type strain using anti-Aip1 antibodies revealed that Aip1 was distributed in cortical  <e1> actin </e1>  patches where  <e2> cofilin </e2>  was also co-localized.

False	We conclude that germ-line involvement of  <e1> MSH6 </e1>  and MSH3 is rare and that other genes are likely to account for a majority of  <e2> MSH2 </e2> -, MLH1-mutation negative families with nonpolypotic colon cancer.
False	Archaeal histones are most similar to the globular  <e1> histone </e1>  fold region of eukaryal histone H4, and the results reported are consistent with archaeal nucleosomes resembling the structure formed by eukaryal histone (H3+ <e2> H4 </e2> )2tetramers.

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of  <e1> histone </e1>  H3: with the purified acetylase, histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
True	The C-terminal of TRADD comprises the "death domain" that is responsible for association of  <e1> TNFR1 </e1>  and other death domain-containing proteins such as  <e2> FADD </e2>  and RIP.
False	A null mutation of the actin gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin ( <e1> TPM1 </e1> ), fimbrin (SAC6), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein ( <e2> CAP1 </e2>  and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.
False	The results indicate that (a) plakoglobin and  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with LEF-1 and vinculin; (b) LEF-1-dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by beta-catenin; and (c) the cytoplasmic partners of beta-catenin,  <e2> cadherin </e2>  and alpha-catenin, can sequester it to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity.

False	We report here that tropomyosin, which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the villin and  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  from the cores but does not affect  <e2> actin </e2>  binding by 110-kD calmodulin.
False	The findings suggest that M1  <e1> muscarinic receptors </e1>  are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor  <e2> AP-1 </e2>  and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

False	We have shown that these proteins are indeed nuclear basic proteins: the 14 kd is the histone  <e1> H4 </e1> , the 19 kd is the histone  <e2> H3 </e2> , and the 25 kd is the sperm-specific protein SP2.
True	Conversely, inhibition of LIMK's activity by expressing a dominant negative construct,  <e1> LIMK1- </e1> , or expression of the constitutively active S3A cofilin mutant induces loss of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments at the phagocytic cup and also inhibits phagocytosis.

False	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all myosin heavy chains, and light chains at least of  <e1> class II myosins </e1> , have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated actin-dependent  <e2> MgATPase </e2>  activity of Dictyostelium myosin II requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor  <e1> AP-1 </e1>  and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via  <e2> p38 </e2>  MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

True	Changes in  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  binding to cadherin or  <e2> APC </e2>  protein, and the ensuing effects on cell morphology and adhesion, are independent of beta-catenin binding to alpha-catenin.
False	The radioresistant N10 and parental KB cell lines were examined for the expression of human DNA repair genes which were related to the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage by northern blot analysis using five kinds of DNA probes ( <e1> XRCC1 </e1> , XRCC3, XRCC5,  <e2> RAD51 </e2> , RAD52).
True	Mechanism of inhibition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent DNA synthesis by the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>   <e2> p21 </e2> .
True	Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin competed with the binding of  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  to  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  and vice versa.
False	Specific antibodies to myosin heavy chain isoforms ( <e1> SM1 </e1> , SM2, SMemb), caldesmon, and  <e2> alpha-smooth muscle actin </e2>  and cDNAs for SMemb were used.

False	Using ITP (a substrate for  <e1> myosin II </e1>  ATPase) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for  <e2> myosin II heavy-chain kinase </e2>  [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that MHCK was localized at the foci.
False	One mutation,  <e1> sac6-69 </e1> , is in the gene encoding fimbrin, another  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2> , which was expected because null mutations in SAC6 and CAP2 are known to be synthetic-lethal.

False	beta-catenin or  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/ <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.
False	The junctional multidomain protein  <e1> AF-6 </e1>  is a binding partner of the Rap1A GTPase and associates with the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeletal regulator profilin.

False	This model includes two different Kd's--one for  <e1> profilin </e1>  bound to actin monomers and one for  <e2> profilin </e2>  bound to an actin molecule at the barbed end of a filament.
True	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of  <e1> Ras </e1>  with  <e2> Myc </e2>  allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI).
False	Our results showed that cell morphology, cell adhesion pattern,  <e1> actin </e1>  organization, and distribution of integrin subunits, talin,  <e2> vinculin </e2> , and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins are dependent on the supramolecular organization of the collagens.

False	Isolation and characterization of death domain (TNF-RI, Fas, TRADD, FADD/MORT-1,  <e1> RIP </e1> ) and TRAF domain-containing proteins (TRAF-1,  <e2> TRAF-2 </e2> , TRAF-3) have partially bridged a large molecular gap within one of several signaling pathways which originate at the plasma membrane and terminate in the nucleus.

False	To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and  <e1> actin </e1> -monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled  <e2> actin </e2>  (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.
False	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in  <e2> p27 </e2> (KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.

True	Here, we show that EID-1 is a potent inhibitor of differentiation and link this activity to its ability to inhibit  <e1> p300 </e1>  (and the highly related molecule, CREB-binding protein, or  <e2> CBP </e2> ) histone acetylation activity.
False	However, some proteins (e.g., profilin) and other agents (e.g., cytochalasin D) that bind to actin are affected by the presence of fluorescent labels, making  <e1> actin </e1>  intrinsic fluorescence potentially useful in investigating the interaction of these agents with actin, and in validating data obtained using labeled  <e2> actin </e2> .

True	Inhibition of actin polymerization by a synthetic dodecapeptide patterned on the sequence around the  <e1> actin </e1> -binding site of  <e2> cofilin </e2> .
True	Thus, both  <e1> DR5 </e1>  and DR4 use FADD,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and FADD is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.
True	This activity is independent of  <e1> FADD-DN </e1> 's ability to bind to three known interacting proteins,  <e2> Fas </e2> , TRADD or RIP suggesting that it is distinct from FADD's functions at activated death receptors.
True	The  <e1> Arp2 </e1> /3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin, consists of seven polypeptides; two actin-related proteins,  <e2> Arp2 </e2>  and Arp3; and five apparently novel proteins, p40, p35, p19, p18, and p14 (Machesky et al., 1994).

False	We have shown that these proteins are indeed nuclear basic proteins: the 14 kd is the histone H4, the 19 kd is the  <e1> histone </e1>  H3, and the 25 kd is the sperm-specific protein  <e2> SP2 </e2> .
False	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative PCAF substrates, histones H3 and  <e1> H4 </e1>  and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that histone H3 is significantly preferred over the  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 and p53 substrates.
False	Lethality of the  <e1> srs2Delta </e1>  rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the  <e2> srs2 </e2>  rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
True	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of  <e1> kinase </e1>  activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to  <e2> cyclin D3 </e2> /CDK4).

True	Archaeal  <e1> histones </e1>  are most similar to the globular  <e2> histone </e2>  fold region of eukaryal histone H4, and the results reported are consistent with archaeal nucleosomes resembling the structure formed by eukaryal histone (H3+H4)2tetramers.
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of  <e1> histone </e1>  H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous  <e2> acetylase(s) </e2> .
False	The cellular morphological changes were analyzed and correlated with the distribution of cell-substratum contacts viewed by confocal images obtained after immunostaining with antibodies raised against the  <e1> fibronectin receptor </e1> , talin, vinculin and  <e2> actin </e2> .

True	Two isoforms of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIB (MHC-IIB) are generated by alternative splicing;  <e1> MHC-IIB(B2) </e1>  differs from MHC-IIB(DeltaB2) by the insertion of B2 exon cassette near the  <e2> actin </e2>  binding region.
False	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p21 </e1> (WAF1/CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol)  <e2> delta </e2>  in the conversion reaction.

False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A,  <e1> H2B </e1> , H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone  <e2> H3 </e2> ; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
True	We have cloned a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene (COF1) encoding a low-M(r)  <e1> actin-binding protein </e1>  of 143 amino acid (aa) residues (yeast cofilin;  <e2> Cof </e2> ); its aa sequence is 35% identical to porcine Cof.
True	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of  <e1> MSH2 </e1> -dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and  <e2> MSH6 </e2>  or MSH2 and MSH3.
False	METHODS AND RESULTS: The frequency-dependent effects of iodotubercidin (ITU, an inhibitor of  <e1> adenosine kinase </e1> ), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, an inhibitor of  <e2> adenosine deaminase </e2> ), draflazine (a nucleoside transport blocker), and PD81,723 (an allosteric enhancer of the A1 adenosine receptor binding) on the stimulus-to-His bundle (SH) interval, a measure of AV nodal conduction, were determined in guinea pig hearts and compared with those of adenosine and diltiazem.
False	These differences in contractile protein profiles between single and cultured cells were collaborated with the observation of cells using immunofluorescence microscope with responsible antibodies to isoforms of  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1> , actin and  <e2> tropomyosin </e2> .
False	Unexpectedly, treatment with the actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin-A disrupted the medial region targeting pattern, and cells deficient in the  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1>  tropomyosin and profilin also did not exhibit medial GFP- <e2> Cdc42p </e2>  staining.
False	Deletion of both  <e1> RAD50 </e1>  and  <e2> RAD51 </e2>  produces a phenotype similar to that produced by deletion of RAD52.

True	Although  <e1> profilin </e1>  released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate  <e2> actin </e2>  assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
False	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase (PNR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), histone  <e1> H1 </e1> , histone H2A + 2B, histone  <e2> H3 </e2> , and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.

False	Although  <e1> profilin </e1>  released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized  <e2> actin </e2>  content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
False	In contrast to the model of  <e1> actin </e1>  binding proposed for fimbrin, the  <e2> utrophin </e2>  actin-binding domain appears to associate with actin in an extended conformation.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone  <e1> H1(0) </e1> , four histone H1 subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone  <e2> H2A.X </e2> , histone H2A.Z, histone H2B, three histone H3 variants and histone H4.

True	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of  <e1> actin </e1>  released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized  <e2> actin </e2>  associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
False	In reconstitution experiments, actin filaments incubated in EGTA with purified  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  and  <e2> villin </e2>  form smooth-sided bundles containing an apparently random number of filaments.

False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with  <e2> profilin </e2>  cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include  <e1> ERCC1 </e1> , ERCC2 (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the HHR23B/p58 and  <e2> HHR23A </e2>  subunits of XPC.
False	The involvement of the death adaptor proteins  <e1> FADD </e1> /MORT1, TRADD, and RIP and the apoptosis-initiating  <e2> caspases-8 </e2>  and -10 in death signaling by the two death-inducing TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) are controversial.

True	In contrast,  <e1> act1-159 </e1>  partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in  <e2> fimbrin </e2> , Mdm20p, and tropomyosin null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these actin-binding proteins.
False	Although talin has been suggested to act as a linkage protein mediating the attachment of GPIIb-IIIa to  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments, direct binding of GPIIb- <e2> IIIa </e2>  to this cytoskeletal protein has not been demonstrated.

False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B,  <e1> H3 </e1> , and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	Two isoforms of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIB ( <e1> MHC-IIB </e1> ) are generated by alternative splicing; MHC-IIB(B2) differs from  <e2> MHC-IIB(DeltaB2) </e2>  by the insertion of B2 exon cassette near the actin binding region.
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the  <e1> Rho </e1>  signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to  <e2> actin </e2> -related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified  <e1> profilin </e1>  without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba  <e2> profilins </e2>  inhibit actin polymerization.

True	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE,  <e1> Fas </e1> , FADD, DR3, FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to  <e2> TNFalpha </e2> -induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
True	The  <e1> cardiac myosin heavy chain </e1>  Arg-403-->Gln mutation that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy does not affect the  <e2> actin </e2> - or ATP-binding capacities of two size-limited recombinant myosin heavy chain fragments.

False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the  <e1> srs2 </e1>   <e2> rad54 </e2>  and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
True	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas,  <e1> FADD </e1> , DR3, FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to  <e2> TNFalpha </e2> -induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

True	However, disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton using Latrunculin-A does not alter verprolin's location, indicating that  <e1> verprolin </e1>  establishes and maintains its location independent of the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton.
True	Purification of cofilin, a 21,000 molecular weight actin-binding protein, from porcine kidney and identification of the  <e1> cofilin </e1> -binding site in the  <e2> actin </e2>  sequence.
False	Analyses of beta-catenin or  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  immunoprecipitates from BMMC lysate revealed that alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin were co-precipitated, suggesting that E-cadherin and  <e2> catenins </e2>  form a complex in mast cells.
True	The apparent critical concentration for polymerization of  <e1> actin </e1>  is increased by the addition of  <e2> profilin </e2> .

True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous  <e1> p21 </e1> /waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/ <e2> waf1 </e2>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.

True	This process involves other  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1> , such as  <e2> cofilin </e2>  and coronin.
False	While levels of most of these proteins decrease, accumulation of  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1>  and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e2> p21 </e2>  Cip1/WAF1 is observed.
False	We have characterized this  <e1> actin </e1>  with respect to its ability to interact with yeast profilin and tropomyosin, the only yeast  <e2> actin-binding proteins </e2>  so far purified and characterized.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and  <e1> DUN1 </e1>  increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9,  <e2> RAD17 </e2> , RAD24, BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.

False	These genes were designated UL5, UL8,  <e1> UL9 </e1> , UL42, and  <e2> UL52 </e2>  and were predicted to encode proteins with molecular weights of, respectively, 99,000, 80,000, 94,000, 51,000, and 114,000.
False	With profilins, whose sequestering activity was low, the concentration of free  <e1> actin </e1>  monomers observed at steady-state of polymerization [Afree], was close to that seen with  <e2> actin </e2>  alone ([Acc], critical concentration of polymerization).
False	This activity is independent of FADD-DN's ability to bind to three known interacting proteins, Fas, TRADD or  <e1> RIP </e1>  suggesting that it is distinct from FADD's functions at activated  <e2> death receptors </e2> .
False	Pervanadate caused a dramatic augmentation of the phosphorylation of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin ( <e2> plakoglobin </e2> ), but alpha-catenin was not detectably phosphorylated.

True	Deletion of  <e1> SIR4 </e1>  enhanced  <e2> mURA3 </e2>  and MET15 silencing, but deletion of SIR1 or SIR3 did not affect silencing, indicating that the mechanism of silencing differs from that at telomeres and silent mating loci.
True	In this recombinant expression system, the  <e1> dystrophin </e1>  relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the  <e2> 87K postsynaptic protein </e2>  from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated beta 1-syntrophin.

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	Since  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  is required for  <e2> cadherin </e2> -mediated adhesion, the armadillo repeat region alone probably cannot promote cell adhesion, making it unlikely that beta-catenin induces axis duplication by increasing cell adhesion.
False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large  <e1> protein </e1>  (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210,  <e2> L </e2> : 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.
True	Since  <e1> RAD54 </e1>  is a recombinational protein associated with  <e2> RAD51 </e2> , this is the first genetic evidence that cancer arises from a defect in repair processes involving homologous recombination.
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of  <e1> Rho </e1>  activation, and mediates the stimulation of  <e2> PLC-delta </e2> , which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.
True	Quantitation of the appearance of X22 banding in primary cultures of myotubes indicates that it precedes that of other myofibrillar proteins and that assembly takes place in the following order: X22,  <e1> titin </e1> ,  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2> , actin, and desmin.
False	 <e1> Gravin </e1>  is not likely to be a nonerythroid spectrin,  <e2> talin </e2> , myosin, or actin-binding protein based on the lack of reactivity of antigravin with these polypeptides in immunoblots.

False	Because other researchers have shown that the RAD51 and RAD52 proteins interact, RAD51 on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the  <e1> rad52-20 </e1>  allele, but RAD 54,  <e2> 55 </e2>  and 57 did not suppress.

True	We have shown that the FH proteins Bni1p and  <e1> Bnr1p </e1>  are potential targets of the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins and bind to an actin-binding protein, profilin, at their proline-rich FH1 domains to regulate reorganization of the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1,  <e1> DBR1 </e1> , CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2,  <e2> BNI1 </e2> , DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.

False	A LIMK2 mutant with replacement of threonine 505 by valine abolished  <e1> LIMK2 </e1>  activities for cofilin phosphorylation and actin cytoskeletal changes, whereas replacement by glutamate enhanced the  <e2> protein kinase </e2>  activity and stress fiber formation by LIMK2.
False	Expression of the  <e1> A8R </e1>  and  <e2> A23R </e2>  genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for VITF-3 in specifically regulating intermediate transcription in vivo.
False	A LIMK2 mutant with replacement of threonine 505 by valine abolished LIMK2 activities for cofilin phosphorylation and  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeletal changes, whereas replacement by glutamate enhanced the protein kinase activity and stress fiber formation by  <e2> LIMK2 </e2> .
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was  <e2> histone </e2>  H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	Bud-site selection directs both cell polarity and the cytoskeletal orientation during budding and is determined by at least five genes: BUD1/RSR1, BUD2,  <e1> BUD3 </e1> , BUD4 and  <e2> BUD5 </e2> .

False	Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  from E-cadherin.
False	From these observations it is concluded that (i) RAD52 is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  and RAD52 have different functions, or that  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  has functions in addition to those of the Rad51/Rad52 protein complex.

True	The ability of these three mutant  <e1> UL5 </e1>  proteins to form specific interactions with other members of the helicase-primase complex, UL8 and  <e2> UL52 </e2> , indicates that the functional domains required for replication activity of UL5 are separable from domains responsible for protein-protein interactions.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a  <e1> glc7-10 </e1>  dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/ <e2> SLG1 </e2>  and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	Analyses of beta-catenin or E-cadherin immunoprecipitates from BMMC lysate revealed that alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  were co-precipitated, suggesting that E-cadherin and  <e2> catenins </e2>  form a complex in mast cells.

False	These results suggest that TNF-alpha can cause apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells through TNFR1-linked apoptotic factors, TRADD, FADD, and  <e1> FLICE </e1> , and  <e2> TNF </e2> -induced ceramide production may be involved in the pathways.
False	METHODS: We immunohistochemically investigated the expression of E-cadherin ( <e1> E-Cad </e1> ), alpha-catenin ( <e2> A-Cat </e2> ) and beta-catenin (B-Cat) during human intrahepatic bile duct development, using 31 fetal livers of various gestational ages.

False	The Tetrahymena  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  has two actin-binding domains, but lacks the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding motif, suggesting that Tetrahymena fimbrin probably cross-links  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments in a Ca(2+)- insensitive manner during cytokinesis.
True	Other mammalian  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1>  such as  <e2> profilin </e2>  and CapG but also fragmin from Physarum polycephalum are similar targets for PIP2-stimulated pp60(c-src) phosphorylation.

False	We propose that profilin may act by forming, during the critical period of cerebellar development, a reserve pool of monomeric  <e1> actin </e1>  that can easily be mobilized in cell regions such as growth cones or synaptic junctions where filamentous  <e2> actin </e2>  is highly concentrated.
True	Conversely, inhibition of  <e1> LIMK </e1> 's activity by expressing a dominant negative construct,  <e2> LIMK1- </e2> , or expression of the constitutively active S3A cofilin mutant induces loss of actin filaments at the phagocytic cup and also inhibits phagocytosis.
False	In vitro studies indicated that suramin completely blocked PDGF receptor activation or phosphorylation stimulated by PDGF-AB, inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) kinases (MEK1/ <e1> 2 </e1> ) and ERK1/ <e2> 2 </e2> , and abrogated transcription factor AP-1 DNA-binding activity.

False	Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of thymosin beta(4) (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between actin and  <e1> thymosin beta(4) </e1> , and explain why thymosin beta(4) and profilin can bind simultaneously to  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	The ratios actin mRNA: <e1> 18S RNA </e1>  and fast myosin heavy chain mRNA: <e2> 18S RNA </e2>  were unaffected by clenbuterol.

False	HGF/ <e1> SF </e1>  treatment of LoVo reduced the amount of alpha-catenin complexed with  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  more markedly than in L-10, but in both cell lines this reduction was not accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin, suggesting the presence of a mechanism other than phosphorylation for release from cell-cell adhesion during cell motility.
False	Mutations that alter putative RNA-binding residues of either HSH49 RRM are lethal in vivo, but do not prevent binding to  <e1> CUS1 </e1>  in vitro, suggesting that the predicted RNA-binding surfaces of HSH49 are not required for interaction with  <e2> CUS1 </e2> .
True	In normal livers, E-cad, alpha-catenin and  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , but not CD44s, CD44v5, CD44v6,  <e2> CD44v7-8 </e2> , and CD44v10, were expressed at the cell membrane of normal intrahepatic bile ducts.
False	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative PCAF substrates, histones  <e1> H3 </e1>  and H4 and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that histone H3 is significantly preferred over the  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 and p53 substrates.

False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1( <e1> p55 </e1> ), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD, DR3, FAF,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

False	Lethality of the srs2Delta  <e1> rad54Delta </e1>  and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2  <e2> rad54 </e2>  and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
False	To characterize the phenotypic alteration in mesangial cells in human glomerulonephritis, we investigated the expression of  <e1> nonmuscle-type myosin heavy chain </e1> , SMemb, and  <e2> alpha-smooth muscle actin </e2>  (alpha-SM actin) in IgA nephropathy.

True	These results suggest that activation of  <e1> PKC </e1>  precedes the activation of PI and  <e2> PIP kinases </e2>  and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1,  <e1> DDC2 </e1>  MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24,  <e2> BUB3 </e2> , and MAD3 had little effect.
False	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and  <e1> MSH6 </e1> , and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either  <e2> MSH2 </e2>  and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.

False	Mutations in  <e1> RAD27 </e1>  cause increased rates of mitotic crossing over and are lethal in combination with mutations in  <e2> RAD51 </e2>  and RAD52.
False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified  <e1> profilin </e1>  without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native  <e2> profilins </e2> ; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.
False	The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that  <e1> cofilin </e1>  binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that  <e2> cofilin </e2>  increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.

False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the  <e1> SAGA </e1>  complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of  <e2> p21 </e2> /waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
True	In most cases,  <e1> ADF </e1>  and  <e2> cofilin </e2>  colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant  <e1> BCK1-20 </e1>  mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the  <e2> Pkc1p </e2>  pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	 <e1> p21 </e1>  (p21WAF1/Cip1), a  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2> , induces G1 arrest and can inhibit the activity of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).

False	We show that the HSV-1 UL5, UL8, UL29,  <e1> UL30 </e1> , UL42, and UL52 gene products along with the AAV  <e2> Rep68 </e2>  protein are sufficient to initiate replication on duplex DNA containing the AAV origins of replication, resulting in products several hundred nucleotides in length.
True	Although both receptors are involved in M21 and H2981 cell adhesion to vitronectin, only a  <e1> alpha v beta 3 </e1>  can be detected in focal contacts, colocalizing with  <e2> vinculin </e2> , talin, and the ends of actin filaments, while alpha v beta 5 shows a distinct, nonfocal contact, distribution on the cell surface.
False	Furthermore, the deletion of  <e1> SJL1 </e1>  suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect of sac6, a mutant in yeast fimbrin, supporting a role for  <e2> synaptojanin </e2>  family members in actin function.
False	To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for  <e1> Fas </e1> , Fas ligand, TNFR-1, TRAIL,  <e2> FADD </e2> , TRADD, RIP, FAF, FAP, and caspase-8.

False	The results indicate that (a) plakoglobin and beta-catenin differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with LEF-1 and  <e1> vinculin </e1> ; (b) LEF-1-dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by beta-catenin; and (c) the cytoplasmic partners of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , cadherin and alpha-catenin, can sequester it to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity.
False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed  <e1> profilins </e1>  form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native  <e2> profilin-I </e2> ; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

True	Immunoprecipitations showed in both cell lines the presence of two different E-cadherin- catenin complexes, one composed of E-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , and the other of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin and plakoglobin.
False	We have characterized the interaction and nuclear localization of the nucleocapsid ( <e1> N </e1> )  <e2> protein </e2>  and phosphoprotein (P) of sonchus yellow net nucleorhabdovirus.
False	One, MORT1 (also called FADD), binds to  <e1> Fas </e1> /APO1 but not to p55-R; another, TRADD, binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to  <e2> Fas </e2> /APO1; and the third, RIP, binds weakly to both receptors.
False	The aim of our study on human seminiferous tubules of adolescent testes was to study the localization of two actin-associated proteins of the adherens junctions, such as  <e1> vinculin </e1>  and  <e2> talin </e2> , and to verify if there were modifications in their pattern in varicocele, a frequent disease of the testis in adolescent age.
False	These histone  <e1> H3 </e1>  and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and H2a mRNA, whereas the histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  and histone H2b genes encode < 10% of the total H4 and H2b mRNA.
False	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins, UL5, UL8, UL9,  <e1> UL42 </e1> ,  <e2> UL52 </e2> , SSB, and Pol, that are essential for viral DNA replication.
True	alpha-Catenin was not associated with these complexes after synthesis, but a subpopulation of  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  joined the complex at a time coincident with the arrival of  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  at the plasma membrane.
True	The UL8 component of the herpes simplex virus helicase-primase complex stimulates primer synthesis by a subassembly of the  <e1> UL5 </e1>  and  <e2> UL52 </e2>  components.
False	 <e1> Integrin </e1>  binding may be promoted by disruption of links to the cytoskeleton, effected through depolymerisation of actin or cleavage of linking protein talin by  <e2> calpain </e2> .
True	Using a complementary sequence or antipeptide to selectively neutralize the stretch of residues 633-642 of  <e1> skeletal myosin heavy chain </e1> , we recently demonstrated that this segment is an  <e2> actin </e2>  binding site operating in the absence as in the presence of nucleotide and that this stretch 633-642 is not part of the nucleotide binding site [Chaussepied & Morales (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 7471-7475].
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12,  <e1> TEC1 </e1> , WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and  <e2> DFG16 </e2> , mutations that block filamentous growth.

True	Disruption of the  <e1> RVS167 </e1>  gene, which is homologous to END6/RVS161 and which is also required for correct  <e2> actin </e2>  localization, also blocks endocytosis.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and  <e2> H2B </e2>  show less heterogeneity.

True	The actin monomer-binding protein, profilin, influences the dynamics of  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments in vitro by suppressing nucleation, enhancing nucleotide exchange on  <e2> actin </e2> , and promoting barbed-end assembly.

False	In investigating the mechanism by which  <e1> pRb </e1>  induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2>  p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.
True	Immunofluorescence experiments showed that, like Abp1p,  <e1> cofilin </e1>  is associated with the membrane  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton.

True	These findings suggest that this novel  <e1> RhoGAP </e1>  is involved in the  <e2> Rho </e2>  signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	The neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, Factor-XIIIa, alpha-smooth muscle actin and CD34, but negative for desmin, calponin, high molecular weight caldesmon,  <e1> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain </e1> ,  <e2> collagen type IV </e2> , laminin and S-100 protein.
False	Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD14 was identified in a two-hybrid screen using MSH2 as "bait," and pairwise interactions between MSH2 and RAD1, RAD2,  <e1> RAD3 </e1> ,  <e2> RAD10 </e2> , RAD14, and RAD25 subsequently were demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis.
True	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of  <e1> MSH2 </e1> -dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires  <e2> MSH2 </e2>  and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.
True	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27( <e1> KIP1 </e1> ) specifically bound to  <e2> cyclin E </e2>  and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.
False	By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds Arp2/3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments and its high affinity for  <e2> actin </e2>  monomers.
True	One, MORT1 (also called FADD), binds to Fas/APO1 but not to p55-R; another,  <e1> TRADD </e1> , binds to the  <e2> p55 </e2>  TNF receptor but not to Fas/APO1; and the third, RIP, binds weakly to both receptors.
False	However, disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton using Latrunculin-A does not alter  <e1> verprolin </e1> 's location, indicating that  <e2> verprolin </e2>  establishes and maintains its location independent of the actin cytoskeleton.
False	The domains in CBP that are involved in  <e1> CREB </e1>  binding and transcriptional activation are highly related to the adenoviral  <e2> E1A </e2> -associated cellular protein p300 (refs 2, 3), and to two hypothetical proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans, R10E11.1 and K03H1.10 (refs 4 and 5, respectively), whose functions are unknown.
True	Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind syntaxin 3 were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the  <e1> syntaxin </e1>  interaction is not the sole determinant of  <e2> Sec1 </e2>  protein membrane attachment.
False	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins, UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> ,  <e2> UL9 </e2> , UL42, UL52, SSB, and Pol, that are essential for viral DNA replication.

True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/ <e1> waf1 </e1>  promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with  <e2> E2A </e2>  in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	Although profilin released  <e1> actin </e1>  at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from  <e2> profilin </e2>  too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant  <e1> BCK1-20 </e1>  mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2,  <e2> HCS77 </e2> /WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal  <e1> actin </e1>  filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with talin, another  <e2> actin </e2>  and vinculin-binding protein from focal adhesions.

False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17,  <e1> RAD24 </e1> , and MEC3, indicating that the  <e2> srs2 </e2>  rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  versus acetylation of  <e2> histone </e2>  H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

False	The very much lower affinity of  <e1> profilin </e1>  for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by  <e2> profilin </e2>  of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.

False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human  <e1> profilins </e1>  rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native  <e2> profilins </e2> ; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

False	The findings suggest that  <e1> M1 </e1>  muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor  <e2> AP-1 </e2>  and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
True	Mechanism of regulation of  <e1> actin </e1>  polymerization by Physarum  <e2> profilin </e2> .
True	Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin is mediated by  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .

False	 <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  and  <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  possibly play more regulatory roles, as it was shown that their tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with modified cadherin activities.
False	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p27 </e1> , enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to  <e2> cyclin E </e2> /CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).

False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD, DR3,  <e1> FAF </e1> , TRADD, and  <e2> RIP </e2>  was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
True	Two isoforms of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIB (MHC-IIB) are generated by alternative splicing; MHC-IIB(B2) differs from  <e1> MHC-IIB(DeltaB2) </e1>  by the insertion of B2 exon cassette near the  <e2> actin </e2>  binding region.
False	Abundance of actin,  <e1> talin </e1> , alpha 5 and beta 1 integrins, pp125 focal adhesion kinase, and  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  is not affected by the differential calreticulin expression.

True	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p21(WAF1/ <e2> CIP1 </e2> ) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol) delta in the conversion reaction.
False	PDGF treatment had no effect on talin, vimentin, or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor ( <e1> EGF </e1> ), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on vinculin or  <e2> actin </e2>  distribution.

True	Acidic domain of the phosphoprotein ( <e1> P </e1> ) of vesicular stomatitis virus differentially interacts with homologous and heterologous  <e2> nucleocapsid protein </e2>  (N).
True	These results indicate that phosphorylation of  <e1> LIM-kinase </e1>  by ROCK and consequently increased phosphorylation of  <e2> cofilin </e2>  by LIM-kinase contribute to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.
True	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of  <e1> MKK1 </e1>  (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a  <e2> glc7-10 </e2>  dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	Western analysis of gel-purified USF-nucleosome and GAL4- <e1> AH </e1> -nucleosome complexes demonstrated the predominant presence of acetylated histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  relative to acetylated histone H3.

True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with  <e1> E2A </e1>  in up-regulation of p21/ <e2> waf1 </e2>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	The undifferentiated cells (a) were unable to spread on gelatin or laminin and grew as rounded colonies, although they were able to spread on fibronectin (b) showed reduced adhesion to  <e1> laminin </e1> , but not fibronectin (c) expressed much reduced levels of beta1 integrin, although levels of alpha5 and alphaV were wild-type (d) were less polarized with increased membrane protrusions compared with a vinculin (-/-) ES cell mutant (e) were unable to assemble  <e2> vinculin </e2>  or paxillin-containing focal adhesions or actin stress fibers on fibronectin, whereas vinculin (-/-) ES cells were able to assemble talin-containing focal adhesions.

False	To investigate the role of  <e1> cofilin </e1>  in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of  <e2> cofilin </e2>  relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.
False	In vitro studies indicated that suramin completely blocked  <e1> PDGF receptor </e1>  activation or phosphorylation stimulated by PDGF-AB, inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( <e2> ERK </e2> ) kinases (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2, and abrogated transcription factor AP-1 DNA-binding activity.
True	Thus, both  <e1> DR5 </e1>  and DR4 use  <e2> FADD </e2> , TRADD, and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and FADD is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.
True	Genetic analysis suggested that this phenotype was due to  <e1> msh6-F337A </e1>  sequestering MSH2 and preventing it from interacting with  <e2> MSH3 </e2>  and MSH6.
False	 <e1> WASp </e1>  contains a binding motif for the  <e2> Rho GTPase </e2>  CDC42Hs as well as verprolin/cofilin-like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific actin structure regulated by CDC42Hs-WASp has been identified.

True	The cofilin homology sequence is critical for stimulating actin nucleation with the  <e1> Arp2 </e1> / <e2> 3 </e2>  complex in vitro, and is essential for actin polymerization and motility in cells.
True	Thus,  <e1> actin </e1>  was found in association with  <e2> fimbrin </e2>  in the mechanoreceptive region of hair cells, whereas supporting cells, although rich in actin, did not reveal fimbrin.

False	One mutation, sac6-69, is in the gene encoding  <e1> fimbrin </e1> , another actin-binding protein, which was expected because null mutations in  <e2> SAC6 </e2>  and CAP2 are known to be synthetic-lethal.
True	These proteins each have a verprolin-homology (V) domain, cofilin-homology (C) domain and an acidic (A) region at the C-terminus, through which they activate the  <e1> Arp2 </e1> / <e2> 3 </e2>  complex, leading to rapid actin polymerization.
False	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the  <e1> cadherin </e1> ; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/ <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

False	This is the first report describing the coexistence of profilin with  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments in the division furrow, implying the possible involvement of  <e2> profilin </e2>  in assembly and disassembly of contractile ring microfilaments in the process of cytokinesis.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <e1> IL-2 </e1>  production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase ( <e2> MAPK </e2> )/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

False	These observations demonstrate that cardiac development in man, in contrast to rodent heart, is characterized by an up-regulation of the  <e1> skeletal actin </e1>  gene, the expression of which does not change in hypertrophied and failing hearts, and suggest that the  <e2> actin </e2>  and myosin heavy chain families are independently regulated in human heart.

False	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase (PNR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), histone H1, histone H2A +  <e1> 2B </e1> , histone H3, and histone  <e2> H4 </e2> , was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.
False	Deletion of SIR4 enhanced mURA3 and MET15 silencing, but deletion of  <e1> SIR1 </e1>  or  <e2> SIR3 </e2>  did not affect silencing, indicating that the mechanism of silencing differs from that at telomeres and silent mating loci.
False	Mutants of  <e1> cdc3 </e1>  and  <e2> cdc8 </e2> , which encode profilin and tropomyosin respectively, display disorganized actin patches in all cells.

False	The ability of these three mutant  <e1> UL5 </e1>  proteins to form specific interactions with other members of the  <e2> helicase-primase </e2>  complex, UL8 and UL52, indicates that the functional domains required for replication activity of UL5 are separable from domains responsible for protein-protein interactions.
False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein ( <e1> NP </e1> ) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein ( <e2> M </e2> ) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.
False	The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin cannot directly associate with  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  but interacts with high affinity with beta-catenin, whereas the binding of  <e2> gamma-catenin </e2>  (plakoglobin) to E-cadherin is less efficient.

True	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1( <e1> p55 </e1> ), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD, DR3, FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to  <e2> TNFalpha </e2> -induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

False	Because other researchers have shown that the  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  and RAD52 proteins interact, RAD51 on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the rad52-20 allele, but  <e2> RAD 54 </e2> , 55 and 57 did not suppress.

True	Munc18-2 is a Sec1 homologue enriched in epithelial cells and forms a complex with  <e1> syntaxin 3 </e1> , a  <e2> t-SNARE </e2>  localized to the apical plasma membrane.
True	Thus, it is most likely that the association between E-cadherin and  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  is mediated by beta-catenin, and that this process is blocked by NH2-terminal deletion in  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a- <e1> 4b </e1> -M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed  <e2> phosphoprotein </e2>  P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  <e1> RFC5 </e1> , DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24,  <e2> BUB3 </e2> , and MAD3 had little effect.
True	One, MORT1 (also called  <e1> FADD </e1> ), binds to  <e2> Fas </e2> /APO1 but not to p55-R; another, TRADD, binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to Fas/APO1; and the third, RIP, binds weakly to both receptors.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 ( <e1> MEKK </e1> ) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and  <e2> MID2 </e2>  also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of  <e1> p27 </e1>  with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of  <e2> kinase </e2>  activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).
False	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that  <e1> vinculin </e1>  has a negligible influence on internal actin filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with  <e2> talin </e2> , another actin and vinculin-binding protein from focal adhesions.

False	Thus, both DR5 and DR4 use FADD,  <e1> TRADD </e1> , and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and  <e2> FADD </e2>  is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.

False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53,  <e1> CHK1 </e1> , PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and  <e2> MAD3 </e2>  had little effect.
True	The tandem repeat domain in the Listeria monocytogenes  <e1> ActA </e1>  protein controls the rate of  <e2> actin </e2> -based motility, the percentage of moving bacteria, and the localization of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and profilin.
False	The core  <e1> histones </e1>  from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3;  <e2> histones </e2>  H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
True	This result was supported by a high protein expression of the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>   <e2> p16 </e2>  in 44% of the tumours with high cyclin E and low D1 expression, and all immunohistochemical pRB defect tumours showed a high p16 protein level.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12,  <e1> TEC1 </e1> ,  <e2> WHI3 </e2> , NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	WASp contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase  <e1> CDC42Hs </e1>  as well as verprolin/cofilin-like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific  <e2> actin </e2>  structure regulated by CDC42Hs-WASp has been identified.
False	Using the known three-dimensional structure of the homologous actin-binding domain of fimbrin, these results have enabled us to determine the likely orientation of the utrophin  <e1> actin </e1> -binding domain with respect to the  <e2> actin </e2>  filament.
False	METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections of five AVMs, CCMs, and control brain tissues were stained immunohistochemically with antibodies to  <e1> alpha-smooth muscle actin </e1>  ( <e2> alpha-SMA </e2> ), myosin heavy chain, and smoothelin, a novel marker for contractile VSMC phenotype.

True	These results emphasize the highly conserved biological function of  <e1> profilins </e1>  with low sequence homology, and correlate specifically their  <e2> actin </e2> -binding capacity with cell motility and proliferation.
False	Treatment with HNE resulted in activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases  <e1> ERK1 </e1>  and ERK2, induction of c-fos and  <e2> c-jun </e2>  protein expression, and an increase in transcription factor AP-1 DNA binding activity.
False	Histone  <e1> H3 </e1>  showed at least seven sites of acetylation, histone H2B.1 had six sites and  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 had five sites.
False	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of  <e1> cyclin E-dependent kinase </e1>  activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2>  (CKI).
False	Panels of six to 31 MAbs against the haemagglutinin (H), fusion (F), nucleocapsid protein ( <e1> NP </e1> ), phosphoprotein ( <e2> P </e2> ) and matrix (M) proteins of MV and the H, F, NP and P proteins of CDV were employed.
False	METHODS: Tumor samples from 77 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were immunohistochemically evaluated for the expression of 10 molecules: the cell cycle-related molecules of cyclin D1,  <e1> Rb </e1> , p16INK4, p27KIP1, and PCNA; the cell-cell adhesion molecules of E-cadherin,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , and beta-catenin; and the heat shock proteins of HSP27 and HSP70.
False	However, these mutants displayed a lower affinity for  <e1> actin </e1>  than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase profilin's affinity for  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	To characterize the AAV functions mediating this effect, cloned AAV type 2 wild-type or mutant genomes were transfected into simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed hamster cells together with the six HSV replication genes (encoding UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> , major DNA-binding protein, DNA polymerase,  <e2> UL42 </e2> , and UL52) which together are necessary and sufficient for the induction of SV40 DNA amplification (R. Heilbronn and H. zur Hausen, J. Virol. 63:3683-3692, 1989).
True	As expected, C/ATF was found to interact with three domains of  <e1> CBP </e1>  including CREB binding domain or kinase-inducible interaction (KIX) domain, the third cysteine-histidine-rich region (CH3 domain) and the nuclear receptor coactivator  <e2> p160/SRC-1 </e2> -interacting domain.
False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE,  <e1> Fas </e1> , FADD, DR3, FAF, TRADD, and  <e2> RIP </e2>  was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

False	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase ( <e1> DHFR </e1> ), ribonucleotide reductase ( <e2> PNR </e2> ), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), histone H1, histone H2A + 2B, histone H3, and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.
False	The core  <e1> histones </e1>  from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule);  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.

False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'- <e1> N </e1> -4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where  <e2> N </e2>  is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
False	Three actin-associated proteins,  <e1> actin-binding protein </e1> , gelsolin, and  <e2> profilin </e2> , influence gelation, solation, and polymerization, respectively, of actin in vitro.
False	Because beta-catenin is known to interact with alpha-catenin, which binds to  <e1> actin </e1> , we generated a fusion molecule consisting of the ectodomain of  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  and the actin binding site of alpha-catenin.
False	Bud-site selection directs both cell polarity and the cytoskeletal orientation during budding and is determined by at least five genes: BUD1/RSR1, BUD2, BUD3,  <e1> BUD4 </e1>  and  <e2> BUD5 </e2> .

True	In resting leukocytes, beta2 integrins are constitutively linked to the  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton via the protein  <e2> talin </e2> .
False	Two isoforms of  <e1> nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIB </e1>  (MHC-IIB) are generated by alternative splicing; MHC-IIB(B2) differs from  <e2> MHC-IIB(DeltaB2) </e2>  by the insertion of B2 exon cassette near the actin binding region.

False	Using ITP (a substrate for myosin II ATPase) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for  <e1> myosin II heavy-chain kinase </e1>  [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that  <e2> MHCK </e2>  was localized at the foci.
False	 <e1> Testicular protein kinase 1 </e1>  ( <e2> TESK1 </e2> ) is a serine/threonine kinase highly expressed in testicular germ cells and has the potential to phosphorylate cofilin and induce actin cytoskeletal reorganization.
False	 <e1> P-cadherin </e1>  expression is a better indicator of clinical outcome than alterations in the expression of E-cadherin,  <e2> N-cadherin </e2> , alpha-catenin, or beta-catenin.
True	This activity is independent of FADD-DN's ability to bind to three known interacting proteins,  <e1> Fas </e1> ,  <e2> TRADD </e2>  or RIP suggesting that it is distinct from FADD's functions at activated death receptors.
True	In these investigations, we determine that recruitment of a coactivator protein,  <e1> CBP </e1>  (the CREBbinding protein), to the  <e2> CYBB </e2>  or NCF2 promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by PU.1, IRF1, and ICSBP.
True	It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  binds either beta-catenin or  <e2> plakoglobin </e2> , which both can assemble alpha-catenin into the complex.
True	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include ERCC1, ERCC2 (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the HHR23B/ <e1> p58 </e1>  and HHR23A subunits of  <e2> XPC </e2> .
True	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of  <e1> MSH2 </e1> -dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or  <e2> MSH2 </e2>  and MSH3.
True	Birch  <e1> profilin </e1>  increased the critical concentration required for muscle and brain  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the notion of the formation of a heterologous complex between the plant protein and animal actin.

True	The head domain of  <e1> talin </e1>  thus binds to integrins to form a link to the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton and can thus regulate integrin function.
True	In order to clarify  <e1> cofilin </e1> -dependent regulation of  <e2> actin </e2>  assembly in muscle cells, cofilin tagged with fluorescence dyes was introduced into C2 myoblasts by a micro injection method.
False	PDGF treatment had no effect on  <e1> talin </e1> , vimentin, or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 30 ng/ml  <e2> somatomedin C </e2> , or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on vinculin or actin distribution.
False	We conclude that Aip1p is a  <e1> cofilin </e1> -associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts  <e2> cofilin </e2>  localization to cortical actin patches.
False	These results indicate that phosphorylation of  <e1> LIM-kinase </e1>  by ROCK and consequently increased phosphorylation of cofilin by  <e2> LIM-kinase </e2>  contribute to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions, histone  <e1> H2A.1 </e1> , histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone H2A.X,  <e2> histone </e2>  H2A.Z, histone H2B, three histone H3 variants and histone H4.

True	In this  <e1> actin </e1>  clustering,  <e2> profilin </e2> , a monomeric actin-binding protein that has been suggested to be involved in actin polymerization, was shown to be essential.
False	No evidence for the surface expression of the phosphoprotein (P), matrix ( <e1> M </e1> ) or nucleocapsid (N)  <e2> proteins </e2>  was found.
False	We conclude that germ-line involvement of  <e1> MSH6 </e1>  and  <e2> MSH3 </e2>  is rare and that other genes are likely to account for a majority of MSH2-, MLH1-mutation negative families with nonpolypotic colon cancer.

False	 <e1> p130 </e1>  and  <e2> pRb </e2>  were phosphorylated before the infected myotubes entered S phase, despite the high expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, and E2F was released.
False	Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of  <e1> thymosin beta(4) </e1>  (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between actin and thymosin beta(4), and explain why  <e2> thymosin beta(4) </e2>  and profilin can bind simultaneously to actin.
False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than  <e1> muscle actin </e1> ; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with  <e2> profilin </e2>  cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	Analyses of beta-catenin or E-cadherin immunoprecipitates from BMMC lysate revealed that alpha-catenin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , and E-cadherin were co-precipitated, suggesting that E-cadherin and  <e2> catenins </e2>  form a complex in mast cells.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified  <e1> histones </e1>  were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone  <e2> H1 </e2>  subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone H2A.X, histone H2A.Z, histone H2B, three histone H3 variants and histone H4.
True	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all myosin heavy chains, and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated actin-dependent  <e1> MgATPase </e1>  activity of Dictyostelium  <e2> myosin II </e2>  requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.
False	Panels of six to 31 MAbs against the haemagglutinin (H), fusion (F), nucleocapsid protein ( <e1> NP </e1> ), phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) proteins of MV and the H, F, NP and P  <e2> proteins </e2>  of CDV were employed.
False	In investigating the mechanism by which  <e1> pRb </e1>  induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e2> p27 </e2> (KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.
False	Hypertonicity provoked Fyn-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in beta-catenin, alpha-catenin, and  <e1> p120 </e1> ( <e2> Cas </e2> ) and caused the dissociation of beta-catenin from the contacts.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone  <e1> H3 </e1> ; histones  <e2> H2A </e2>  and H2B show less heterogeneity.

False	We found that the down-regulation of  <e1> E-cad </e1> , alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression,  <e2> Ki-67 </e2>  labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.

True	In addition to the TNF-alpha-induced increase in the general protein synthesis, stimulation with  <e1> TNF-alpha </e1>  led to a 2.4-fold increase in net actin protein synthesis and a 3.3-fold increase in net  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  synthesis.
True	The structure of Ykt6pN differed entirely from that of syntaxin and resembled the overall fold of the  <e1> actin </e1>  regulatory protein,  <e2> profilin </e2> .
False	In COS-7 cells overexpressing a N-WASP mutant lacking the proline-rich domain (Deltap) unable to interact with  <e1> profilin </e1> , the  <e2> actin </e2>  tail formation of intracellular Shigella was inhibited.

True	 <e1> Aip1p </e1>  interacts with cofilin to disassemble  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments.
False	The hyperproliferative response observed in the gastric mucosa is secondary to this initial insult and is associated with increased expression of  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1> , the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16ink4a and of  <e2> p53 </e2>  and decreased expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1.
True	 <e1> Armadillo </e1>  (Arm) repeat 10 to the COOH terminus of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  is involved in binding to CBP, whereas beta-catenin interacts directly with the CREB-binding domain of CBP.
True	 <e1> Class II profilins </e1>  had higher affinity for poly-l-proline and sequestered more monomeric  <e2> actin </e2>  than did class I profilins.
False	Analyses of beta-catenin or E-cadherin immunoprecipitates from BMMC lysate revealed that alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  were co-precipitated, suggesting that  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  and catenins form a complex in mast cells.

False	We found that the down-regulation of E-cad,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , and beta-catenin expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression,  <e2> Ki-67 </e2>  labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.
False	The analysis of the viral proteins by electrophoresis indicates molecular weight differences between CDV and PDV in the fusion (F), phosphoprotein (P), H, nucleocapsid ( <e1> N </e1> ) and matrix (M)  <e2> proteins </e2> .
False	Histone H3 showed at least seven sites of acetylation, histone  <e1> H2B.1 </e1>  had six sites and histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  had five sites.

True	Immunoprecipitation with an E-cadherin mAb, which is known to co-precipitate the catenins, demonstrated that the three poorly differentiated cell lines expressing  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  did not co-precipitate  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , although all of the moderately-well differentiated cell lines expressed both alpha- and beta-catenin.
False	One, MORT1 (also called FADD), binds to  <e1> Fas </e1> /APO1 but not to p55-R; another, TRADD, binds to the p55  <e2> TNF receptor </e2>  but not to Fas/APO1; and the third, RIP, binds weakly to both receptors.

False	Thus, both  <e1> DR5 </e1>  and DR4 use FADD, TRADD, and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and  <e2> FADD </e2>  is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.
False	A null mutation of the actin gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin (TPM1), fimbrin (SAC6),  <e1> Abp1p </e1>  (ABP1), and capping protein (CAP1 and  <e2> CAP2 </e2> ) genes have relatively mild or no effects.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of  <e1> MKK1 </e1>  (MEK) or MPK1 ( <e2> MAP kinase </e2> ) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone  <e1> H2A.X </e1> , histone  <e2> H2A.Z </e2> , histone H2B, three histone H3 variants and histone H4.
False	Sequences upstream of the coding region for RAD51 protein share homology with the damage response sequence element of RAD54, an upstream activating sequence required for damage regulation of the  <e1> RAD54 </e1>  transcript, and also contain two sites for restriction enzyme MluI; the presence of  <e2> MluI </e2>  restriction sites has been associated with cell cycle regulation.

False	This technique was employed to quantify changes caused by the lack of talin, a protein that couples the actin network to the plasma membrane, or by the lack of cortexillin I or  <e1> II </e1> , two isoforms of the  <e2> actin </e2> -bundling protein cortexillin.
False	Although both receptors are involved in M21 and H2981 cell adhesion to vitronectin, only a alpha v beta 3 can be detected in focal contacts, colocalizing with  <e1> vinculin </e1> , talin, and the ends of actin filaments, while  <e2> alpha v beta 5 </e2>  shows a distinct, nonfocal contact, distribution on the cell surface.
False	Thus, mHip1R contains an NH(2)-terminal domain homologous to that implicated in  <e1> Sla2p </e1> 's endocytic function, three predicted coiled-coils, a leucine zipper, and a talin-like  <e2> actin </e2> -binding domain at the COOH terminus.

False	Total protein, myosin heavy chain ( <e1> MHC </e1> ), and  <e2> actin </e2>  appeared unchanged with SVT cardiomyopathy at the LV or myocyte level.
False	In these investigations, we determine that recruitment of a coactivator protein,  <e1> CBP </e1>  (the  <e2> CREBbinding protein </e2> ), to the CYBB or NCF2 promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by PU.1, IRF1, and ICSBP.
False	The two cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms, alpha and beta, differ functionally, alpha Myosin exhibits higher actin-activated ATPase than does  <e1> beta myosin </e1> , and hearts expressing alpha myosin exhibit increased contractility relative to hearts expressing  <e2> beta myosin </e2> .
False	Unexpectedly, treatment with the actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin-A disrupted the medial region targeting pattern, and cells deficient in the  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1>  tropomyosin and profilin also did not exhibit medial  <e2> GFP </e2> -Cdc42p staining.
False	One mutation,  <e1> sac6-69 </e1> , is in the gene encoding fimbrin, another actin-binding protein, which was expected because null mutations in SAC6 and  <e2> CAP2 </e2>  are known to be synthetic-lethal.

True	We have examined the level of cyclin E, a G1 cyclin, and  <e1> p27kip </e1> , a  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2> , in BALB/c 3T3 cells.
False	Mitochondrial genes (16.2%),  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  genes (9%) and the  <e2> actin alpha skeletal muscle </e2>  gene (9%) were the most abundant transcripts.
False	A reconstitution is described that requires not only the growth factor, its receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, and the soluble  <e1> phospholipase C-gamma 1 </e1> , but also the small soluble  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2>  profilin.
False	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous  <e1> myogenin </e1>  and myosin light chain 2 gene but not the endogenous MyoD1, MRF4, Myf5, the  <e2> skeletal muscle actin </e2> , or the myosin heavy chain genes.
False	Deletion of both  <e1> RAD50 </e1>  and RAD51 produces a phenotype similar to that produced by deletion of  <e2> RAD52 </e2> .
True	In flattened cells under starvation stress,  <e1> cofilin </e1>  localized at dramatically reorganizing  <e2> actin </e2> -cytoskeletons in ruffling membranes of the leading edge, but not at rigid actin meshwork in focal adhesion plaques.
False	Transfection of plasmids encoding the BRSV minigenome, nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein ( <e1> P </e1> ) and L protein, each under the control of T7 promoter, into cells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the T7 RNA polymerase gave rise to  <e2> CAT </e2>  activity and progeny with the minigenome.
False	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous  <e1> myogenin </e1>  and myosin light chain 2 gene but not the endogenous MyoD1, MRF4, Myf5, the skeletal muscle actin, or the  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  genes.
False	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include ERCC1,  <e1> ERCC2 </e1>  (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the HHR23B/p58 and  <e2> HHR23A </e2>  subunits of XPC.
False	In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry on sectioned  <e1> Myf-5 </e1>  and MyoD mutant embryos with antibodies reactive with desmin,  <e2> nestin </e2> , myosin heavy chain, sarcomeric actin, Myf-5, MyoD and myogenin.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones  <e2> H2A </e2>  and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11,  <e1> MEC1 </e1> , DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24,  <e2> BUB3 </e2> , and MAD3 had little effect.
False	This effect is specific to  <e1> profilin </e1>  and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as tau or actin do not affect  <e2> PI 3-kinase </e2>  activity.
False	Full-length  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , beta-catenin mutant proteins with NH2-terminal deletions before (deltaN90) or after ( <e2> deltaN131 </e2> , deltaN151) the alpha-catenin binding site, or a mutant beta-catenin with a COOH-terminal deletion (delta C) were expressed in MDCK cells under the control of the tetracycline-repressible transactivator.
False	 <e1> Glutathione S-transferase </e1>  pull-down performed with  <e2> Tax </e2>  deletion mutants and peptide competition have localized the site in Tax critical for binding CBP/p300 to a highly protease-sensitive region around amino acid residues 81 to 95 (81QRTSKTLKVLTPPIT95) which lies between the domains previously proposed to be important for CREB binding and Tax subunit dimerization.
False	One mutation, sac6-69, is in the gene encoding fimbrin, another  <e1> actin-binding protein </e1> , which was expected because null mutations in SAC6 and  <e2> CAP2 </e2>  are known to be synthetic-lethal.
False	Single-headed myosin, which consists of a full length  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  and a tagged tail, was isolated on the basis of the affinities for Nickel agarose and  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that  <e1> histone </e1>  H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of  <e2> p21 </e2> /waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
True	Most of these integrins, with their intracellular domains, interact with the  <e1> actin </e1> -containing cytoskeleton, via linking proteins such as vinculin and  <e2> talin </e2> , while one of them interacts with the keratin filaments, via an as yet unknown linking molecule(s).
False	Equine satellite cell clone SE-11 and ovine satellite cell clone I(1)were evaluated for expression of myosin heavy chain, myogenin,  <e1> desmin </e1> , and  <e2> muscle-specific actin </e2>  over a 240 h period in culture.
False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large protein ( <e1> L </e1> ) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700,  <e2> P </e2> : 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210, L: 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked  <e1> PKC1 </e1>  as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as  <e2> ROM2 </e2> , RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	METHODS: Ileal and colonic biopsy specimens from 19 SpA patients with subclinical inflammatory gut lesions and from seven controls were stained with monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  and  <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  and a polyclonal antibody against alpha-catenin.
False	A chimera consisting of the  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> -binding region of beta-catenin linked to the amino terminus of  <e2> alpha-catenin 57-264 </e2>  behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since beta-catenin binding disrupts the alpha-catenin dimer.
False	Furthermore, the deletion of SJL1 suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect of  <e1> sac6 </e1> , a mutant in yeast  <e2> fimbrin </e2> , supporting a role for synaptojanin family members in actin function.
False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <e2> actin </e2>  with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	We have shown that these proteins are indeed nuclear basic proteins: the 14 kd is the  <e1> histone </e1>  H4, the 19 kd is the histone H3, and the 25 kd is the sperm-specific protein  <e2> SP2 </e2> .
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function;  <e1> M </e1>  is the proposed  <e2> matrix protein </e2>  gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
True	In vitro studies indicated that suramin completely blocked PDGF receptor activation or phosphorylation stimulated by PDGF-AB, inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK)  <e1> kinases </e1>  (MEK1/ <e2> 2 </e2> ) and ERK1/2, and abrogated transcription factor AP-1 DNA-binding activity.
False	To characterize the AAV functions mediating this effect, cloned AAV type 2 wild-type or mutant genomes were transfected into simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed hamster cells together with the six HSV replication genes (encoding UL5, UL8,  <e1> major DNA-binding protein </e1> ,  <e2> DNA polymerase </e2> , UL42, and UL52) which together are necessary and sufficient for the induction of SV40 DNA amplification (R. Heilbronn and H. zur Hausen, J. Virol. 63:3683-3692, 1989).
True	To our knowledge,  <e1> AF-6 </e1>  is the only integral component in cell-cell junctions discovered thus far that interacts with  <e2> profilin </e2>  and thus could modulate actin modeling proximal to adhesion complexes.
False	As expected, C/ATF was found to interact with three domains of CBP including  <e1> CREB </e1>  binding domain or  <e2> kinase </e2> -inducible interaction (KIX) domain, the third cysteine-histidine-rich region (CH3 domain) and the nuclear receptor coactivator p160/SRC-1-interacting domain.
True	Within 1 hour of raising the concentration of calcium ions, integrins, cadherins, alpha-catenin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , plakoglobin, vinculin and alpha-actinin appeared to accumulate at cell-cell borders, whereas the focal contact proteins,  <e2> paxillin </e2>  and talin, did not.
True	The domains in  <e1> CBP </e1>  that are involved in  <e2> CREB </e2>  binding and transcriptional activation are highly related to the adenoviral E1A-associated cellular protein p300 (refs 2, 3), and to two hypothetical proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans, R10E11.1 and K03H1.10 (refs 4 and 5, respectively), whose functions are unknown.
False	From these observations it is concluded that (i) RAD52 is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that RAD51 and RAD52 have different functions, or that  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  has functions in addition to those of the  <e2> Rad51 </e2> /Rad52 protein complex.
False	The undifferentiated cells (a) were unable to spread on gelatin or laminin and grew as rounded colonies, although they were able to spread on fibronectin (b) showed reduced adhesion to laminin, but not  <e1> fibronectin </e1>  (c) expressed much reduced levels of beta1 integrin, although levels of alpha5 and alphaV were wild-type (d) were less polarized with increased membrane protrusions compared with a vinculin (-/-) ES cell mutant (e) were unable to assemble vinculin or paxillin-containing focal adhesions or actin stress fibers on fibronectin, whereas  <e2> vinculin </e2>  (-/-) ES cells were able to assemble talin-containing focal adhesions.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3;  <e2> histones </e2>  H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	Actophorin and  <e1> profilin </e1>  have opposite effects on the rate of exchange of nucleotide bound to  <e2> actin </e2>  monomers.

False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to  <e1> actin </e1>  in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native  <e2> profilin-I </e2> ; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the  <e1> Rho </e1>  signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to  <e2> actin binding proteins </e2>  such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	The sequences of the predicted HMP-1, HMP-2, and  <e1> HMR-1 </e1>  proteins are related to the  <e2> cell adhesion proteins </e2>  alpha-catenin, beta-catenin/Armadillo, and classical cadherin, respectively.

False	In Acanthamoeba actin polymerization is regulated, at least in part, by  <e1> profilin </e1> , which binds to actin monomers, and by  <e2> capping protein </e2> , which both nucleates polymerization and blocks monomer addition at the 'barbed' end of the filament.
False	The radioresistant N10 and parental KB cell lines were examined for the expression of human DNA repair genes which were related to the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage by northern blot analysis using five kinds of DNA probes ( <e1> XRCC1 </e1> ,  <e2> XRCC3 </e2> , XRCC5, RAD51, RAD52).
False	The  <e1> adenosine deaminase </e1> -binding region is distinct from major anti-CD26 mAb epitopes on the human dipeptidyl peptidase IV( <e2> CD26 </e2> ) molecule.
False	These results suggest that LIMK2 functions downstream of the Rho- <e1> ROCK </e1>  signalling pathway and plays a role in reorganization of actin filaments and membrane structures, by phosphorylating  <e2> cofilin/ADF </e2>  proteins.
False	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p21(WAF1/CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase ( <e2> Pol </e2> ) delta in the conversion reaction.
False	These histone H3 and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and H2a mRNA, whereas the  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 and histone  <e2> H2b </e2>  genes encode < 10% of the total H4 and H2b mRNA.
False	Effects of  <e1> macrophage profilin </e1>  on actin in the presence and absence of  <e2> acumentin </e2>  and gelsolin.

True	The Arp2/3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin, consists of seven polypeptides; two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3; and five apparently novel proteins,  <e1> p40 </e1> , p35,  <e2> p19 </e2> , p18, and p14 (Machesky et al., 1994).
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone  <e1> H4 </e1> , and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the  <e2> SAGA </e2>  complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

False	Analysis of profilin: actin crystals reveals an extensive intermolecular network, rather than a discrete "monomeric complex", comprising stacked  <e1> actin </e1>  ribbons held in place by columns of  <e2> profilin </e2>  molecules, wedged in between neighboring actin subunits and running perpendicular to the ribbons.
True	One complex is composed of E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin, the other of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin and  <e2> plakoglobin </e2> .
False	The adventitial tissue underlying PTCA-induced lesions temporarily expressed  <e1> alpha-SM actin </e1> , desmin, and SM myosin heavy chain isoforms, but not  <e2> smoothelin </e2> .
True	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all myosin heavy chains, and light chains at least of  <e1> class II myosins </e1> , have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated actin-dependent MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium  <e2> myosin II </e2>  requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.
False	The p120cas gene encodes a  <e1> protein tyrosine kinase </e1>  substrate that associates with the cell-cell adhesion protein complex containing E-cadherin and its cytoplasmic cofactors alpha-catenin,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , and plakoglobin.

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified  <e1> acetylase </e1> , histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was  <e2> histone </e2>  H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or  <e1> MPK1 </e1>  (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/ <e2> SLG1 </e2>  and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	Immunohistochemistry for a variety of cytokeratins (CKs) (8/18, 1/10, 7, and 20),  <e1> epithelial membrane antigen </e1>  (EMA), S-100 protein, vimentin  <e2> CD34 </e2> , type IV collagen, smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and glial fibrillary acid protein was performed.

True	Here we demonstrate that  <e1> type XIII collagen </e1>  is concentrated in cultured skin fibroblasts and several other human mesenchymal cell lines in the focal adhesions at the ends of actin stress fibers, co-localizing with the known focal adhesion components  <e2> talin </e2>  and vinculin.
True	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of  <e1> ActA </e1>  binds one actin monomer, in a  <e2> profilin </e2> -like fashion, and Arp2/3 complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of WASp family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by Arp2/3 complex.
False	The sizes and characteristics of each of the proteins determined from various radiolabelling experiments allowed preliminary identification of the proteins as the large (L; 190 kDa), haemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN; 74 kDa), nucleocapsid (N; 66 kDa), fusion (F0; 63 kDa), phosphoprotein (P; 49 kDa), matrix (M; 43 kDa) and non-structural (V; 35 kDa)  <e1> p <e2> roteins </e1>  </e2> .
True	 <e1> ActA </e1>  appears to control at least four functions that collectively lead to actin-based motility: (1) initiation of  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization, (2) polarization of ActA function, (3) transformation of actin polymerization into a motile force and (4) acceleration of movement mediated by the host protein profilin.
False	These proteins also compose the essential heterotrimeric splicing factor  <e1> SF3a </e1> , and products of yeast pre-mRNA processing genes PRP9,  <e2> PRP11 </e2> , and PRP21 are their likely yeast counterparts.
False	From these observations it is concluded that (i) RAD52 is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  and RAD52 have different functions, or that RAD52 has functions in addition to those of the Rad51/ <e2> Rad52 </e2>  protein complex.
False	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include  <e1> ERCC1 </e1> , ERCC2 (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the  <e2> HHR23B </e2> /p58 and HHR23A subunits of XPC.
False	In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on alpha-catenin that allow it to associate with  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> /plakoglobin and with  <e2> alpha-actinin </e2> .
False	The  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  ( <e2> P </e2> ) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotypes New Jersey [P(NJ)] and Indiana [P(I)] contains a highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain which is required for binding to the cognate N-RNA template as well as to form a soluble complex with the nucleocapsid protein N in vivo.
False	These proteins each have a  <e1> verprolin </e1> -homology (V) domain,  <e2> cofilin </e2> -homology (C) domain and an acidic (A) region at the C-terminus, through which they activate the Arp2/3 complex, leading to rapid actin polymerization.
True	Armadillo (Arm) repeat 10 to the COOH terminus of beta-catenin is involved in binding to CBP, whereas beta-catenin interacts directly with the  <e1> CREB </e1> -binding domain of  <e2> CBP </e2> .
False	Thus,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> ,  <e2> E-cadherin </e2> , and alpha-catenin have similar prognostic values.

True	This effect is specific to profilin and gelsolin because other cytoskeletal proteins such as  <e1> tau </e1>  or actin do not affect  <e2> PI 3-kinase </e2>  activity.
False	Expression of the A8R and  <e1> A23R </e1>  genes occurred between 1 and 5 h after vaccinia virus infection and was not prevented by an inhibitor of DNA replication, consistent with a role for  <e2> VITF-3 </e2>  in specifically regulating intermediate transcription in vivo.

False	Archaeal histones are most similar to the globular histone fold region of eukaryal  <e1> histone </e1>  H4, and the results reported are consistent with archaeal  <e2> nucleosomes </e2>  resembling the structure formed by eukaryal histone (H3+H4)2tetramers.
False	Treatment with HNE resulted in activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, induction of  <e1> c-fos </e1>  and c-jun protein expression, and an increase in transcription factor  <e2> AP-1 </e2>  DNA binding activity.
False	The findings suggest that M1  <e1> muscarinic receptors </e1>  are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase ( <e2> MAPK </e2> )/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
False	The inhibitory effects of rapamycin on bombesin-stimulated cell cycle progression did not involve accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27( <e1> kip1 </e1> ) but a striking inhibition of the expression of  <e2> cyclin D1 </e2> .
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in  <e1> muscarinic receptor </e1> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the  <e2> muscarinic receptor </e2> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

True	The microvillus cytoskeleton, isolated from chicken intestinal epithelial cell brush borders, is known to contain five major protein components, the 110,000-dalton polypeptide, villin (95,000 daltons),  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  (68,000 daltons),  <e2> actin </e2>  (43,000 daltons), and calmodulin (17,000 daltons).

False	The radioresistant N10 and parental KB cell lines were examined for the expression of human DNA repair genes which were related to the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage by northern blot analysis using five kinds of DNA probes (XRCC1,  <e1> XRCC3 </e1> ,  <e2> XRCC5 </e2> , RAD51, RAD52).
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 ( <e1> MEKK </e1> ) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2,  <e2> RHO2 </e2> , HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase,  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was  <e2> histone </e2>  H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of actin that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and actin-monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled  <e1> actin </e1>  (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit  <e2> DNase I </e2> .
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not  <e1> histone </e1>  H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that  <e2> CBP </e2> /p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human  <e1> profilin </e1>  yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast  <e2> profilin </e2>  and pyrene-labeled yeast actin.
False	However, in non-adherent cells no molecular mechanism has yet been proposed for the cell adhesion-dependent up-regulation of the p27  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  (CKI), and the associated inhibition of  <e2> cyclin E </e2> -CDK2.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2,  <e1> BNI1 </e1> , DFG5, DFG9,  <e2> DFG10 </e2> , BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of  <e1> PLC-delta </e1> , which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  and profilin.
False	A null mutation of the actin gene ( <e1> ACT1 </e1> ) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin (TPM1),  <e2> fimbrin </e2>  (SAC6), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein (CAP1 and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.

False	beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin,  <e1> p120 </e1> ( <e2> cas </e2> ) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.

False	However, once initiated, the synthesis of  <e1> muscle tropomyosin </e1>  mRNA continued in the presence of cycloheximide, while the expression of muscle actin, myosin heavy chain, and  <e2> myogenin </e2>  mRNA was abolished.
True	By two-hybrid screening we have identified two partners that directly associate with  <e1> TIF34 </e1> : PRT1, a previously characterized eIF3 subunit, and a novel protein of 33 kDa ( <e2> eIF3-p33 </e2> ) which is part of the eIF3 complex and has an RNA binding domain.

True	Recent evidence that  <e1> profilin </e1>  inhibits  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  and enhances nucleotide exchange of actin has led some to question whether profilin is ever truly an actin monomer sequestering agent.
False	Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and  <e1> actin </e1>  raised the possibility that  <e2> profilin </e2>  might also regulate lipid metabolism.
False	We found that the down-regulation of  <e1> E-cad </e1> , alpha-catenin, and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.
True	 <e1> PF4 </e1> -dependent downregulation of cyclin E- <e2> cdk2 </e2>  activity was associated with increased binding of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(Cip1/WAF1), to the cyclin E-cdk2 complex.

True	These results indicate that phosphorylation of LIM-kinase by  <e1> ROCK </e1>  and consequently increased phosphorylation of  <e2> cofilin </e2>  by LIM-kinase contribute to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.
False	By indirect immunofluorescence, both R. rickettsii and Listeria monocytogenes  <e1> actin </e1>  tails were shown to contain the cytoskeletal proteins vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein profilin, vinculin, and  <e2> filamin </e2> .

True	In flattened cells under starvation stress,  <e1> cofilin </e1>  localized at dramatically reorganizing actin-cytoskeletons in ruffling membranes of the leading edge, but not at rigid  <e2> actin </e2>  meshwork in focal adhesion plaques.
False	Deletion of SIR4 enhanced  <e1> mURA3 </e1>  and  <e2> MET15 </e2>  silencing, but deletion of SIR1 or SIR3 did not affect silencing, indicating that the mechanism of silencing differs from that at telomeres and silent mating loci.
True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous  <e1> p21 </e1> /waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/ <e2> p300 </e2> , and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

True	 <e1> Aprotinin </e1>  inhibited platelet aggregation induced by thrombin (0.25 U.ml-1) with IC50 200 kIU.ml-1, and inhibited the rise of cytosolic free calcium concentration in platelets stimulated by thrombin (0.1 U.ml-1) in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+ 0.5 mmol.L-1 (IC50 117 and 50 kIU.ml-1, respectively), but had no effect on the amounts of actin and  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  associated with cytoskeletons.
True	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the  <e1> syntrophin </e1> -binding region of  <e2> dystrophin </e2> , utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.
False	The core  <e1> histones </e1>  from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and  <e2> H2B </e2>  show less heterogeneity.

False	PDGF treatment had no effect on talin, vimentin, or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM  <e1> insulin </e1>  also had no effect on  <e2> vinculin </e2>  or actin distribution.
True	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of ActA binds one actin monomer, in a profilin-like fashion, and Arp2/3 complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of WASp family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by  <e1> Arp2 </e1> / <e2> 3 </e2>  complex.

True	In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the  <e1> MSH2 </e1>  protein and the  <e2> MSH3 </e2>  and MSH6 proteins.
False	The differential localization of the three  <e1> actin </e1>  monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an  <e2> actin </e2>  monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.
True	The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human  <e1> platelet profilin </e1>  for rabbit  <e2> actin </e2>  (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins.
False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9,  <e1> RAD17 </e1> , RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2 rad54 and srs2  <e2> rdh54 </e2>  mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
False	From these observations it is concluded that (i)  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that RAD51 and RAD52 have different functions, or that RAD52 has functions in addition to those of the  <e2> Rad51 </e2> /Rad52 protein complex.

False	Thus, both DR5 and DR4 use  <e1> FADD </e1> , TRADD, and  <e2> RIP </e2>  in their signal transduction pathways, and FADD is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.
True	Reinvestigation of the inhibition of  <e1> actin </e1>  polymerization by  <e2> profilin </e2> .
False	PtK2 cells of exceptionally large size were microinjected with fluorescently labeled probes for  <e1> actin </e1> , myosin,  <e2> filamin </e2> , and talin in order to follow the assembly of the contractile proteins into the cleavage furrows.
False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other:  <e1> profilin </e1>  has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <e2> actin </e2>  with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2, histone H2A.X, histone  <e1> H2A.Z </e1> , histone H2B, three histone  <e2> H3 </e2>  variants and histone H4.
False	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the  <e1> cadherin </e1> ;  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in  <e1> muscarinic receptor </e1> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and  <e2> c-Jun N-terminal kinase </e2> , but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1( <e1> p55 </e1> ), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD,  <e2> DR3 </e2> , FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
False	The main inhibitory action of p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( <e1> CDKI </e1> ), arises from its binding with the  <e2> cyclin E </e2> /cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex that results in G(1)-S arrest.

False	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1  <e1> CDK </e1>  activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with Myc allows the generation of  <e2> cyclin E-dependent kinase </e2>  activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI).
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  versus acetylation of histone  <e2> H3 </e2> : with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

True	This activity is independent of  <e1> FADD-DN </e1> 's ability to bind to three known interacting proteins, Fas, TRADD or  <e2> RIP </e2>  suggesting that it is distinct from FADD's functions at activated death receptors.
False	To determine the phenotypes of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in such lesions, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissues from two patients with PPH, using two antimuscle actin antibodies, HHF35 and CGA7, and two anti- <e1> SMC myosin heavy chain </e1>  markers, anti-SM1 and anti- <e2> SM2 </e2>  antibodies and related antibodies.

True	The differential localization of the three  <e1> actin </e1>  monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an actin monomer-binding protein; (2) profilin II regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3)  <e2> actobindin </e2>  inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.

False	Determination of the total profilin and actin concentrations in PMN revealed that the molar ratio of  <e1> profilin </e1>  to  <e2> actin </e2>  was 1 to 5.2.
True	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal actin filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with  <e1> talin </e1> , another  <e2> actin </e2>  and vinculin-binding protein from focal adhesions.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in  <e1> muscarinic receptor </e1> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor  <e2> AP-1 </e2>  and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

False	The head domain of talin thus binds to integrins to form a link to the  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton and can thus regulate  <e2> integrin </e2>  function.
False	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21( <e1> WAF1 </e1> /CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase ( <e2> Pol </e2> ) delta in the conversion reaction.
False	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  linked to the amino terminus of alpha-catenin 57-264 behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  binding disrupts the alpha-catenin dimer.

False	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate  <e1> actin </e1>  assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of  <e2> actin </e2>  released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
True	 <e1> CD26 </e1> , a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV, is directly associated with  <e2> adenosine deaminase </e2>  (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines.

False	Interaction between nucleocapsid protein ( <e1> NP </e1> ) and phosphoprotein (P) of human parainfluenza virus type 2: one of the two NP binding sites on  <e2> P </e2>  is essential for granule formation.
False	The sizes and characteristics of each of the proteins determined from various radiolabelling experiments allowed preliminary identification of the proteins as the large (L; 190 kDa), haemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN; 74 kDa), nucleocapsid ( <e1> N </e1> ; 66 kDa), fusion (F0; 63 kDa), phosphoprotein (P; 49 kDa), matrix (M; 43 kDa) and non-structural (V; 35 kDa)  <e2> proteins </e2> .
True	Newly disclosed interactions between gephyrin, exchange factors for  <e1> G proteins </e1>  of the Rho and  <e2> Rac </e2>  families, the translational regulator RAFT1, and actin-binding proteins like profilin might integrate activity-dependent and trophic-factor-mediated signals at developing postsynaptic sites.
False	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all  <e1> myosin heavy chains </e1> , and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated actin-dependent  <e2> MgATPase </e2>  activity of Dictyostelium myosin II requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.
False	The undifferentiated cells (a) were unable to spread on gelatin or laminin and grew as rounded colonies, although they were able to spread on fibronectin (b) showed reduced adhesion to laminin, but not fibronectin (c) expressed much reduced levels of  <e1> beta1 integrin </e1> , although levels of alpha5 and alphaV were wild-type (d) were less polarized with increased membrane protrusions compared with a vinculin (-/-) ES cell mutant (e) were unable to assemble vinculin or paxillin-containing focal adhesions or  <e2> actin </e2>  stress fibers on fibronectin, whereas vinculin (-/-) ES cells were able to assemble talin-containing focal adhesions.
False	Because other researchers have shown that the RAD51 and  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  proteins interact, RAD51 on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the rad52-20 allele, but  <e2> RAD 54 </e2> , 55 and 57 did not suppress.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  <e1> RFC5 </e1> , DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53,  <e2> CHK1 </e2> , PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.
False	From these observations it is concluded that (i)  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that RAD51 and  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  have different functions, or that RAD52 has functions in addition to those of the Rad51/Rad52 protein complex.
False	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative PCAF substrates, histones H3 and  <e1> H4 </e1>  and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 is significantly preferred over the histone H4 and p53 substrates.
False	In a model system, the interacting proteins recruiting TFIIIC to DNA were  <e1> PRP21 </e1>  and PRP9 or PRP21 and  <e2> PRP11 </e2> .
False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other:  <e1> profilin </e1>  has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments;  <e2> profilin </e2>  inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for Fas, Fas ligand, TNFR-1,  <e1> TRAIL </e1> , FADD, TRADD, RIP, FAF, FAP, and  <e2> caspase-8 </e2> .
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene;  <e1> G </e1>  is the proposed  <e2> glycoprotein </e2>  gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
False	Isolation and characterization of death domain (TNF-RI,  <e1> Fas </e1> , TRADD, FADD/MORT-1, RIP) and TRAF domain-containing proteins (TRAF-1,  <e2> TRAF-2 </e2> , TRAF-3) have partially bridged a large molecular gap within one of several signaling pathways which originate at the plasma membrane and terminate in the nucleus.
False	Removal of the amino-terminal tails of either histone  <e1> H3 </e1>  or histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  allowed these polyamides to bind.
True	The monomeric  <e1> actin-binding protein </e1> ,  <e2> profilin </e2> , is a key regulator of actin-filament dynamics in animal cells and it has recently been identified in plants as a pollen allergen.
False	Semiserial sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to  <e1> alpha-smooth muscle actin </e1>  (alpha-SMA), desmin and  <e2> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain </e2>  isoforms: SM1, SM2 and SMemb.
True	Other mammalian  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1>  such as profilin and  <e2> CapG </e2>  but also fragmin from Physarum polycephalum are similar targets for PIP2-stimulated pp60(c-src) phosphorylation.
True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that  <e1> CBP </e1> /p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with  <e2> E2A </e2>  in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
True	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>   <e2> p21 </e2> (WAF1/CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol) delta in the conversion reaction.
False	The tandem repeat domain in the Listeria monocytogenes ActA protein controls the rate of  <e1> actin </e1> -based motility, the percentage of moving bacteria, and the localization of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
True	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated;  <e1> histone </e1>   <e2> H4 </e2>  shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
True	Thus,  <e1> mHip1R </e1>  contains an NH(2)-terminal domain homologous to that implicated in Sla2p's endocytic function, three predicted coiled-coils, a leucine zipper, and a talin-like  <e2> actin </e2> -binding domain at the COOH terminus.
False	Fusiform RPE, however, were not deficient in these proteins, expressing amounts of N-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , beta-catenin, plakoglobin,  <e2> p120 </e2> , alpha-actinin and vinculin that were equivalent to epithelioid cells.
False	Using ITP (a substrate for myosin II  <e1> ATPase </e1> ) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for  <e2> myosin II heavy-chain kinase </e2>  [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that MHCK was localized at the foci.
True	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin;  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  binds to  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> /plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.
False	YACs containing  <e1> color vision red pigment </e1>  gene DNA or 1.5 rDNA tandem repeat units were transformed into hosts bearing lesions at the RAD1, RAD6, RAD51, or  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  loci.
False	The muscle-related genes included actin, tropomyosin, troponin I, myosin regulatory light chain,  <e1> myosin light chain kinase </e1> ,  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2> , calmodulin, calponin, calcium vector protein, creatine kinase, muscle LIM protein, and SH3-binding glutamate-rich protein, suggesting that vertebrate skeletal and smooth muscle-type genes are simultaneously expressed in the amphioxus notochord.
False	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized  <e1> actin </e1>  content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of  <e2> actin </e2>  released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 ( <e1> MAP kinase </e1> ) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2,  <e2> HCS77 </e2> /WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	Here, we show that  <e1> EID-1 </e1>  is a potent inhibitor of differentiation and link this activity to its ability to inhibit p300 (and the highly related molecule,  <e2> CREB-binding protein </e2> , or CBP) histone acetylation activity.
False	The herpes simplex virus type-1 DNA helicase-primase is a heterotrimer encoded by the UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> , and  <e2> UL52 </e2>  genes.
True	In contrast, act1-159 partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in  <e1> fimbrin </e1> , Mdm20p, and tropomyosin null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these  <e2> actin </e2> -binding proteins.
True	The influence of these  <e1> collagens </e1>  on cell morphology and the distribution pattern of actin, vimentin,  <e2> talin </e2> , and vinculin was analyzed by light microscopy, conventional electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and immunogold labeling after lysis-squirting.

False	To characterize the AAV functions mediating this effect, cloned AAV type 2 wild-type or mutant genomes were transfected into simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed hamster cells together with the six HSV replication genes (encoding  <e1> UL5 </e1> , UL8, major DNA-binding protein,  <e2> DNA polymerase </e2> , UL42, and UL52) which together are necessary and sufficient for the induction of SV40 DNA amplification (R. Heilbronn and H. zur Hausen, J. Virol. 63:3683-3692, 1989).
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant  <e1> BCK1-20 </e1>  mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2,  <e2> RHO2 </e2> , HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	To test for regional differences in the rates of synthesis and degradation of contractile proteins during normal physiological growth of the heart in vivo, fractional rates of protein accumulation and synthesis were assessed for total protein,  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1> , myosin light chain, phosphorylatable myosin light chain, and  <e2> actin </e2>  in the right and left ventricular free walls of growing, New Zealand White rabbits.
False	Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of thymosin beta(4) (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between  <e1> actin </e1>  and thymosin beta(4), and explain why thymosin beta(4) and profilin can bind simultaneously to  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked  <e1> PKC1 </e1>  as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed  <e2> glc7-10 </e2>  effectively.
True	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of  <e1> histone </e1>   <e2> H3 </e2> ; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes,  <e1> CDC39 </e1> , STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10,  <e2> BUD8 </e2>  and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	These histone H3 and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and  <e1> H2a </e1>  mRNA, whereas the histone H4 and histone H2b genes encode < 10% of the total H4 and  <e2> H2b </e2>  mRNA.

False	The affinity of yeast  <e1> profilin </e1>  for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human  <e2> platelet profilin </e2>  for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins.
True	Cotransfections with different combinations of these genes demonstrated that a subset of four of them, coding for the HSV helicase-primase complex (UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> ,  <e2> UL52 </e2> ) and the major DNA-binding protein (UL29), was already sufficient to mediate the helper effect.

False	Analysis of changes in state suggests that SIR1 protein has a role in the establishment but not the maintenance of repression of silent mating type genes, whereas SIR2,  <e1> SIR3 </e1> , and  <e2> SIR4 </e2>  are required for maintenance.

True	These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits  <e1> cofilin </e1>  to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization.
True	Molecular analysis of the cadherin-catenin complex elucidated the central role of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  in this adhesion complex, as it binds to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin and to  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> .
False	The sizes and characteristics of each of the proteins determined from various radiolabelling experiments allowed preliminary identification of the proteins as the large (L; 190 kDa), haemagglutinin neuraminidase ( <e1> HN </e1> ; 74 kDa), nucleocapsid (N; 66 kDa), fusion (F0; 63 kDa), phosphoprotein (P; 49 kDa), matrix (M; 43 kDa) and non-structural (V; 35 kDa)  <e2> proteins </e2> .

False	In these investigations, we determine that recruitment of a coactivator protein, CBP (the CREBbinding protein), to the CYBB or NCF2 promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by  <e1> PU.1 </e1> , IRF1, and  <e2> ICSBP </e2> .
False	The interaction between calf  <e1> spleen profilin </e1>  and actin depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the actin, and in the case of  <e2> profilin </e2> , the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.
False	PDGF treatment had no effect on  <e1> talin </e1> ,  <e2> vimentin </e2> , or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on vinculin or actin distribution.
False	From an analysis of profilin mutants, whose  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton is disrupted, we found that E-APC also requires  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments to associate with adhesive cell membranes in the ovary.
False	The presence of  <e1> filamin </e1>  in the cleavage furrows also suggests the possibility of an overlapping mechanism in addition to that of a  <e2> talin </e2>  mediated mechanism for the attachment of actin filaments to the cell surfaces in the cleavage furrow.
False	They had altered adhesive properties as measured by their ability to bind to a fibronectin-coated glass surface, suggesting that the expression of a rac-1 GAP alters the assembly of  <e1> integrin </e1>  receptors,  <e2> actin </e2>  and cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin and talin.
False	Adherens junction proteins ( <e1> N-cadherin </e1> , E-cadherin, alpha-catenin,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , plakoglobin, and actin) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were localized in the cultures by fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro wound healing was compared.

False	Confluent calf pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers exposed to 95% oxygen for 1, 2, or 3 days exhibit a time-dependent increase in adherence to substratum, which closely parallels changes in  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoarchitecture and the distribution of focal contact proteins  <e2> vinculin </e2>  and talin.

False	Although neither activation of  <e1> BCK1 </e1>  (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/ <e2> WSC1 </e2> /SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	In order to help explain the apparent beneficial effects of  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1>  over-expression, a number of closely associated cell cycle proteins have also been evaluated, including the  <e2> cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor </e2>  p27, which blocks the activating effects of cyclin D1.
False	To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal  <e1> actin </e1>  binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for  <e2> TD77 </e2>  and actin binding.
False	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21( <e1> WAF1 </e1> / <e2> CIP1 </e2> ) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol) delta in the conversion reaction.
False	The activation of the c-Raf-1-BxB-ER protein leads to an accumulation of high levels of  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1>  protein and a repression of the  <e2> p27Kip1 </e2>  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor under all culture conditions tested.
True	Genetic analysis suggested that this phenotype was due to  <e1> msh6-F337A </e1>  sequestering  <e2> MSH2 </e2>  and preventing it from interacting with MSH3 and MSH6.
False	We find that  <e1> profilin </e1>  and  <e2> cofilin </e2>  regulate actin-filament formation throughout the cell cortex.
False	Immunoprecipitations showed in both cell lines the presence of two different E-cadherin- catenin complexes, one composed of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, and the other of  <e2> E-cadherin </e2> , alpha-catenin and plakoglobin.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 ( <e1> MEKK </e1> ) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as  <e2> ROM2 </e2> , RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, p120( <e1> cas </e1> ) or  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.

False	In contrast, talin, another putative  <e1> actin </e1> -membrane linker protein, could not be detected in significant amounts in human neutrophils using a polyclonal antibody raised against chicken gizzard talin, which reacted with human platelet and lymphocyte  <e2> talin </e2> .
False	Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 can stimulate the  <e1> Brca1 </e1>  promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the p16(INK4a)  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2> .
False	Immunohistochemical studies showed a strong reactivity of most LAM cells for alpha-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and a weak to moderate reactivity of a lesser number of cells for  <e1> desmin </e1>  and  <e2> nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-B </e2> .
True	From these observations it is concluded that (i) RAD52 is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that RAD51 and RAD52 have different functions, or that RAD52 has functions in addition to those of the  <e1> Rad51 </e1> / <e2> Rad52 </e2>  protein complex.
False	The  <e1> polycystic kidney disease 1 </e1>  gene product mediates protein kinase C alpha-dependent and  <e2> c-Jun N-terminal kinase </e2> -dependent activation of the transcription factor AP-1.
False	Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of  <e1> profilin </e1>  and actin raised the possibility that  <e2> profilin </e2>  might also regulate lipid metabolism.
True	When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7-4 microM thymosin-beta4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 microM K(D) for  <e1> Thymosin-beta4 </e1> . <e2> Actin </e2> ).
False	Yeast profilin can sequester yeast actin monomers and thereby reduce the ability of yeast  <e1> actin </e1>  to polymerize, whereas it has little effect on the degree of polymerization of rabbit  <e2> skeletal muscle actin </e2> .
True	Archaeal histones are most similar to the globular histone fold region of eukaryal histone H4, and the results reported are consistent with archaeal nucleosomes resembling the structure formed by eukaryal  <e1> histone </e1>  ( <e2> H3 </e2> +H4)2tetramers.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of  <e1> histone </e1>  H3; histones  <e2> H2A </e2>  and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	RESULTS: E-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> ,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  and gamma-catenin were expressed in a normal membranous pattern in all normal bladder epithelium specimens.
False	To determine the phenotypes of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in such lesions, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissues from two patients with PPH, using two antimuscle actin antibodies, HHF35 and  <e1> CGA7 </e1> , and two anti- <e2> SMC myosin heavy chain </e2>  markers, anti-SM1 and anti-SM2 antibodies and related antibodies.

False	The genes considered are those for 5S, 5.8S and  <e1> 18S rRNA </e1> , actin I, profilins Ia/ <e2> b </e2>  and II, myosins IB, IC and II, and calmodulin.
True	The cellular transcription co-activators  <e1> p300 </e1>  and the CREB-binding protein CBP are cellular targets for transformation by the  <e2> E1A </e2>  proteins of non-oncogenic adenovirus 5 (Ad5).
False	Immunofluorescence microscopy of cells grown on fibronectin confirmed the presence of paxillin,  <e1> talin </e1> , and  <e2> vinculin </e2>  at the ends of actin stress fibers at presumptive focal contacts in melanocytes.
False	METHODS: Tumor samples from 77 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were immunohistochemically evaluated for the expression of 10 molecules: the cell cycle-related molecules of  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1> , Rb, p16INK4, p27KIP1, and PCNA; the cell-cell adhesion molecules of  <e2> E-cadherin </e2> , alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin; and the heat shock proteins of HSP27 and HSP70.
False	The Arp2/3 complex with full-length Scar, Scar containing P, W, and A domains, or  <e1> Scar </e1>  containing W and A domains overcomes inhibition of nucleation by the  <e2> actin </e2>  monomer-binding protein profilin, giving active nucleation over a low background of spontaneous nucleation.
False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other:  <e1> profilin </e1>  has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than  <e2> muscle actin </e2> ; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	As a consequence, in the presence of thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4), low amounts of  <e1> profilin </e1>  promote extensive actin assembly off of the pool of  <e2> actin </e2> -T beta 4 complex.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis:  <e1> histone </e1>  H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized  <e2> histone </e2>  H2A.2, histone H2A.X, histone H2A.Z, histone H2B, three histone H3 variants and histone H4.
False	In CC, membranous expression of E-cad,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  was the same or reduced when compared with non-cancerous bile ducts in the majority of CC.
False	These proteins each have a verprolin-homology (V) domain,  <e1> cofilin </e1> -homology (C) domain and an acidic (A) region at the C-terminus, through which they activate the Arp2/ <e2> 3 </e2>  complex, leading to rapid actin polymerization.
False	These proteins also compose the essential heterotrimeric splicing factor  <e1> SF3a </e1> , and products of yeast pre-mRNA processing genes PRP9, PRP11, and  <e2> PRP21 </e2>  are their likely yeast counterparts.
True	 <e1> Actin-binding proteins </e1>  such as profilin and  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric actin.
False	LOH was found in the RAD51 region in 32% of tumours, in the  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  region in 16%, in RAD54 in 20% and in the  <e2> BRCA1 </e2>  and BRCA2 regions in 49% and 44% respectively.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes,  <e1> CDC39 </e1> , STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1,  <e2> CDC55 </e2> , SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	The cofilin homology sequence is critical for stimulating actin nucleation with the  <e1> Arp2 </e1> /3 complex in vitro, and is essential for  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization and motility in cells.
False	Transfection of plasmids encoding the BRSV minigenome, nucleocapsid protein (N),  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  (P) and L protein, each under the control of T7 promoter, into cells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the T7  <e2> RNA polymerase </e2>  gave rise to CAT activity and progeny with the minigenome.
False	Immunoblot and Northern blot analyses also revealed the presence of alpha-catenin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , and gamma-catenin ( <e2> plakoglobin </e2> ) in these cell lines.
True	On the basis of these results, we present a model for prereplicative site formation in infected cells in which the helicase-primase components ( <e1> UL5 </e1> ,  <e2> UL8 </e2> , and UL52), the origin-binding protein (UL9), and the viral single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ICP8) assemble together to initiate the process.
False	The two cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms, alpha and beta, differ functionally, alpha Myosin exhibits higher  <e1> actin </e1> -activated ATPase than does beta myosin, and hearts expressing alpha myosin exhibit increased contractility relative to hearts expressing  <e2> beta myosin </e2> .
False	Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of  <e1> thymosin beta(4) </e1>  (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between actin and thymosin beta(4), and explain why thymosin beta(4) and  <e2> profilin </e2>  can bind simultaneously to actin.
True	These results suggest that the dysfunction of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , and that this defect results from the mutation in beta-catenin.
False	beta-catenin or  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/ <e2> catenin </e2>  complex to the actin cytoskeleton.
False	Here, we have detected a polypeptide in rat rod outer segments that is recognized by  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  antibodies and was found to possess other characteristics of conventional non-muscle myosin heavy chain: it comigrates in SDS-PAGE with  <e2> non-muscle myosin heavy chain </e2> ; it associates with the cytoskeleton of rod outer segments in an ATP-sensitive manner; and it binds to purified actin filaments in the absence of ATP.
False	Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD14 was identified in a two-hybrid screen using  <e1> MSH2 </e1>  as "bait," and pairwise interactions between MSH2 and RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD10,  <e2> RAD14 </e2> , and RAD25 subsequently were demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis.
False	In contrast, EC located immediately behind the migrating front retained junctional  <e1> VE-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin while  <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  was absent from these sites.
False	Using the 'nuclear displacement assay' as a measure of the integrity of the  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton in living stamen hair cells, we demonstrated that AtFim1 protects  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments in these cells from Z. mays profilin (ZmPRO5)-induced depolymerization, in a dose-dependent manner.
False	Adherens junction proteins ( <e1> N-cadherin </e1> , E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, plakoglobin, and  <e2> actin </e2> ) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were localized in the cultures by fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro wound healing was compared.
False	In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest requires the checkpoint control genes RAD9, RAD17,  <e1> RAD24 </e1> , MEC1, MEC2 and  <e2> MEC3 </e2> .
False	Loss of normal surface  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> ,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , beta-catenin and gamma-catenin expression was found in 52/68 (76.4%) tumors, 57/68 (83.8%) tumors, 54/68 (79.4%) tumors and 54/68 (79.4%) tumors (p <0.001).
False	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the amino terminus of  <e1> alpha-catenin 57-264 </e1>  behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since beta-catenin binding disrupts the  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  dimer.
False	AIMS: To investigate the disturbance of intercellular adhesion in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), we examined the ultrastructural localization of E-cadherin (E-cad), alpha-catenin ( <e1> alpha-cat </e1> ) and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  (beta-cat) in ACC, and compared it with that in the normal labial gland.
True	Although talin has been suggested to act as a linkage protein mediating the attachment of GPIIb-IIIa to actin filaments, direct binding of  <e1> GPIIb </e1> - <e2> IIIa </e2>  to this cytoskeletal protein has not been demonstrated.
False	The serine phosphatases  <e1> PP1 </e1>  and PP2A associate with and activate the  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2>  cofilin in human T lymphocytes.
False	The genes considered are those for 5S, 5.8S and  <e1> 18S rRNA </e1> , actin I, profilins Ia/b and II,  <e2> myosins IB </e2> , IC and II, and calmodulin.
True	Results from epistasis analyses indicate that  <e1> MSH2 </e1>  functions in mismatch repair in conjunction with  <e2> MSH3 </e2>  or MSH6 and that MSH3 and MSH6 constitute alternate pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair.
False	Seventeen embryonic genes were identified as embryonic alpha-tubulin, embryonic beta-tubulin, hnRNP, protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT),  <e1> ferritin heavy chain </e1> , type IV collagen, actin-binding protein  <e2> cofilin </e2> , profilin and nine novel sequences designated as A1-9.
True	Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was concomitantly induced with association of beta-catenin with EGF receptor (EGFR) when quiescent cells at confluence were dissociated into single cells by tryptic digestion, being accompanied by dissociation of  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  from  <e2> E-cadherin </e2> .
True	The involvement of the death adaptor proteins  <e1> FADD </e1> /MORT1, TRADD, and RIP and the apoptosis-initiating caspases-8 and -10 in death signaling by the two death-inducing  <e2> TRAIL receptors 1 </e2>  and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) are controversial.
False	Sequences upstream of the coding region for  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  protein share homology with the damage response sequence element of RAD54, an upstream activating sequence required for damage regulation of the  <e2> RAD54 </e2>  transcript, and also contain two sites for restriction enzyme MluI; the presence of MluI restriction sites has been associated with cell cycle regulation.
False	The PRT1, TIF34,  <e1> GCD10 </e1> , and  <e2> SUI1 </e2>  proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were found previously to copurify with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) activity.
True	RIPc, one of the cleavage products, enhanced interaction between  <e1> TRADD </e1>  and FADD/ <e2> MORT1 </e2>  and increased cells' sensitivity to TNF.
False	The cellular morphological changes were analyzed and correlated with the distribution of cell-substratum contacts viewed by confocal images obtained after immunostaining with antibodies raised against the fibronectin receptor,  <e1> talin </e1> , vinculin and  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	No significant changes in glomerular  <e1> vinculin </e1> , talin, beta 1-integrin, or total  <e2> actin </e2>  expression occurred at any time point during disease development.
False	METHODS: We have performed a detailed study of the pattern of expression of myosin heavy chain ( <e1> MHC </e1> ), myosin light chain (MLC), troponin I (TnI) isoforms, connexin 43 ( <e2> Cx43 </e2> ), desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), in the ventricular conduction system of normal and congenitally malformed mouse hearts (iv background) from embryonic day 14.5 to 19.5.
False	Abundance of actin, talin, alpha 5 and beta 1  <e1> integrins </e1> ,  <e2> pp125 </e2>  focal adhesion kinase, and alpha-catenin is not affected by the differential calreticulin expression.
False	This activity is independent of FADD-DN's ability to bind to three known interacting proteins, Fas, TRADD or  <e1> RIP </e1>  suggesting that it is distinct from  <e2> FADD </e2> 's functions at activated death receptors.
False	Thus, the  <e1> actin </e1> -binding dodecapeptide sequence of cofilin may constitute a multifunctional domain in  <e2> cofilin </e2> .
False	To characterize the phenotypic alteration in mesangial cells in human glomerulonephritis, we investigated the expression of  <e1> nonmuscle-type myosin heavy chain </e1> ,  <e2> SMemb </e2> , and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SM actin) in IgA nephropathy.
False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains  <e1> nucleocapsid protein </e1>  (NP) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein ( <e2> M </e2> ) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.
True	The phosphoprotein ( <e1> P </e1> ) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotypes New Jersey [P(NJ)] and Indiana [P(I)] contains a highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain which is required for binding to the cognate N-RNA template as well as to form a soluble complex with the nucleocapsid protein  <e2> N </e2>  in vivo.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  <e1> RFC5 </e1> , DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in  <e2> RAD9 </e2> , RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.
False	In this study we aimed to determine which type of expression abnormalities for  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> ,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  and alpha-catenin correlate with clinico-pathological features and survival in gastric cancer.
False	Profilins also bind polyphosphoinositides, which can disrupt the profilin- <e1> actin </e1>  complex, and proline-rich ligands which localize profilin to sites requiring extensive  <e2> actin </e2>  filament accumulation.
True	A truncated  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  disrupts the interaction between E-cadherin and  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> : a cause of loss of intercellular adhesiveness in human cancer cell lines.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed  <e1> glycoprotein </e1>  gene; and L is the proposed  <e2> transcriptase </e2>  gene.
True	Specific antibodies to  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  isoforms (SM1, SM2,  <e2> SMemb </e2> ), caldesmon, and alpha-smooth muscle actin and cDNAs for SMemb were used.
False	In addition, we also provide new evidence to suggest that HRG stimulation of the  <e1> EF-1alpha </e1>  promoter involves increased physical interactions with acetylated histone H3 and  <e2> histone </e2>  H4.
False	PDGF treatment had no effect on talin, vimentin, or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor ( <e1> EGF </e1> ), 30 ng/ml  <e2> somatomedin C </e2> , or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on vinculin or actin distribution.
True	Thus, like verprolin,  <e1> WIP </e1>  functions in yeast to link the polarity development pathway and the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton to generate cytoskeletal asymmetry.
True	The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  and  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  is species-specific.
False	The genes considered are those for 5S, 5.8S and  <e1> 18S rRNA </e1> ,  <e2> actin I </e2> , profilins Ia/b and II, myosins IB, IC and II, and calmodulin.
True	Acidic domain of the  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  (P) of vesicular stomatitis virus differentially interacts with homologous and heterologous nucleocapsid protein ( <e2> N </e2> ).
True	Our findings strongly suggest that in brain profilin I and  <e1> profilin II </e1>  complexes link the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic membrane flow, directing actin and  <e2> clathrin </e2>  assembly to distinct membrane domains.
False	The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that  <e1> cofilin </e1>  binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to  <e2> actin </e2>  monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.
False	The Schizosaccharomyces pombe rhp51+, rad22+ and  <e1> rhp54+ </e1>  genes are homologous to RAD51,  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  and RAD54 respectively, which are indispensable in the recombinational repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
True	Our results showed that cell morphology, cell adhesion pattern, actin organization, and distribution of integrin subunits,  <e1> talin </e1> , vinculin, and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins are dependent on the supramolecular organization of the  <e2> collagens </e2> .
False	Compared with control and contralateral kidneys, the ligated kidneys displayed a dynamic expression of mRNAs for many apoptosis-related molecules, which included an up to threefold increase for Fas, Fas ligand, TNF-R1, TRAIL,  <e1> TRADD </e1> , RIP, and caspase-8, and an up to twofold increase for  <e2> FADD </e2>  and FAP, but there was little change for FAF.
False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17,  <e1> RAD24 </e1> , and  <e2> MEC3 </e2> , indicating that the srs2 rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2,  <e1> TPM1 </e1> ,  <e2> SPA2 </e2> , BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'- <e1> N </e1> -4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and  <e2> 4b </e2>  are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
False	The ability of these three mutant  <e1> UL5 </e1>  proteins to form specific interactions with other members of the helicase-primase complex, UL8 and UL52, indicates that the functional domains required for replication activity of  <e2> UL5 </e2>  are separable from domains responsible for protein-protein interactions.
True	We also analysed NHEJ in other DNA damage response mutants and showed that the checkpoint mutant rad3-d and two recombination mutants defective in rhp51 and  <e1> rhp54 </e1>  (homologues of S.cerevisiae RAD51 and  <e2> RAD54 </e2> , respectively) are not affected.
False	Here, we show that PRP5 (a  <e1> DEAD box helicase </e1> -like protein),  <e2> PRP9 </e2> , and PRP11 are each required for the U2 snRNP to bind to the pre-spliceosome during spliceosome assembly in vitro.
False	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins, UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> , UL9, UL42, UL52,  <e2> SSB </e2> , and Pol, that are essential for viral DNA replication.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions,  <e1> histone </e1>  H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized histone H2A.2,  <e2> histone </e2>  H2A.X, histone H2A.Z, histone H2B, three histone H3 variants and histone H4.
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone  <e2> H3 </e2> , whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	As a nuclear transport signal sequence exists in  <e1> cofilin </e1>  and ADF but not in actin, ADF and/or  <e2> cofilin </e2>  may be responsible for the nuclear import of actin in myogenic cells under certain conditions.
True	 <e1> act1-157 </e1> , an actin mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in  <e2> actin </e2>  organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a profilin mutant defective in actin binding.
True	The I/LWEQ module is a conserved sequence that we have identified as an  <e1> actin </e1> -binding motif in the metazoan focal adhesion protein  <e2> talin </e2>  and the yeast protein Sla2p.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone  <e2> H3 </e2>  has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	Lethality of the srs2Delta  <e1> rad54Delta </e1>  and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and  <e2> MEC3 </e2> , indicating that the srs2 rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
True	We have previously shown that the synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to Trp104-Met115 of  <e1> cofilin </e1>  is a potent inhibitor of  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization (Yonezawa, N., Nishida, E., Iida, K., Kumagai, H., Yahara, I., and Sakai, H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10485-10489).
False	The assay detects the high-affinity binding of actin to actin-binding proteins ( <e1> ABPs </e1> ),  <e2> cofilin </e2>  or DNase I.
True	The hyperproliferative response observed in the gastric mucosa is secondary to this initial insult and is associated with increased expression of cyclin D1, the  <e1> cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>   <e2> p16ink4a </e2>  and of p53 and decreased expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1.

False	In this work we report that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD9, RAD24, RAD17,  <e1> MEC1 </e1> , MEC3 and  <e2> RAD53 </e2>  checkpoint genes are required for efficient non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
False	The centrifugation assay and the  <e1> DNase I </e1>  inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to  <e2> actin </e2>  monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.
True	Immunofluorescence microscopy of cells grown on fibronectin confirmed the presence of paxillin, talin, and  <e1> vinculin </e1>  at the ends of  <e2> actin </e2>  stress fibers at presumptive focal contacts in melanocytes.
False	alpha-Sm actin inhibition also led to the formation of less prominent focal adhesions as revealed by immunofluorescence staining against  <e1> vinculin </e1> ,  <e2> talin </e2> , and beta1-integrin.
False	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS),  <e1> dihydrofolate reductase </e1>  (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase (PNR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),  <e2> histone </e2>  H1, histone H2A + 2B, histone H3, and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.
False	However, the recombinant fusion protein containing wild-type  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  precipitated  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  from these cells.
False	Isolation and characterization of death domain (TNF-RI, Fas, TRADD,  <e1> FADD </e1> / <e2> MORT-1 </e2> , RIP) and TRAF domain-containing proteins (TRAF-1, TRAF-2, TRAF-3) have partially bridged a large molecular gap within one of several signaling pathways which originate at the plasma membrane and terminate in the nucleus.
False	In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry on sectioned Myf-5 and  <e1> MyoD </e1>  mutant embryos with antibodies reactive with desmin,  <e2> nestin </e2> , myosin heavy chain, sarcomeric actin, Myf-5, MyoD and myogenin.

False	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p27, enhanced association of  <e2> p27 </e2>  with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).
False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein ( <e1> P </e1> ), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large protein (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057,  <e2> F </e2> : 6621-7210, L: 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.
False	Although  <e1> profilin </e1>  released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of  <e2> profilin </e2>  in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
False	The APC binding site on  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with  <e2> APC </e2> , although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin.
True	Although  <e1> talin </e1>  has been suggested to act as a linkage protein mediating the attachment of GPIIb-IIIa to actin filaments, direct binding of  <e2> GPIIb </e2> -IIIa to this cytoskeletal protein has not been demonstrated.
False	Immunoprecipitations showed in both cell lines the presence of two different E-cadherin- catenin complexes, one composed of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin and  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , and the other of  <e2> E-cadherin </e2> , alpha-catenin and plakoglobin.

False	However, a number of mammalian DNA repair proteins lack NLS clusters; these proteins include  <e1> ERCC1 </e1> , ERCC2 (XPD), mouse RAD51, and the HHR23B/p58 and HHR23A subunits of  <e2> XPC </e2> .
False	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that  <e1> pRb </e1>  causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2>  p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or  <e1> MPK1 </e1>  (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2,  <e2> HCS77 </e2> /WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	RESULTS: Reduced normal expression of E-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  in comparison with normal epithelium was detected in 78 primary tumors, respectively.

False	Immuno-EM double-labeling experiments were conducted with antibodies to  <e1> actin </e1>  together with antibodies to the  <e2> actin binding proteins </e2>  Abp1p and cofilin.
True	These observations demonstrate that cardiac development in man, in contrast to rodent heart, is characterized by an up-regulation of the skeletal actin gene, the expression of which does not change in hypertrophied and failing hearts, and suggest that the  <e1> actin </e1>  and  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  families are independently regulated in human heart.
True	A 2.2-kb truncated NRP1 cDNA was cloned that encodes a 644-aa soluble NRP1 (sNRP1) isoform containing just the a/CUB and b/ <e1> coagulation factor </e1>  homology extracellular domains of  <e2> NRP1 </e2> .
False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9,  <e1> RAD17 </e1> , RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2 rad54 and  <e2> srs2 </e2>  rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
False	Furthermore, the deletion of  <e1> SJL1 </e1>  suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect of sac6, a mutant in yeast  <e2> fimbrin </e2> , supporting a role for synaptojanin family members in actin function.
False	The muscle-related genes included actin, tropomyosin, troponin I, myosin regulatory light chain, myosin light chain kinase,  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1> , calmodulin, calponin, calcium vector protein,  <e2> creatine kinase </e2> , muscle LIM protein, and SH3-binding glutamate-rich protein, suggesting that vertebrate skeletal and smooth muscle-type genes are simultaneously expressed in the amphioxus notochord.

False	 <e1> PDGF </e1>  treatment had no effect on talin,  <e2> vimentin </e2> , or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on vinculin or actin distribution.
False	Immunoreactivity for  <e1> pan-cadherin </e1> , E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and  <e2> p120 </e2>  was observed in all 15 specimens.
False	Depending on the nature of the divalent cation, recombinant plant (birch)  <e1> profilin </e1>  exhibited two different modes of interaction with actin, like mammalian  <e2> profilin </e2> .
True	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified  <e1> acetylase </e1> , histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	Mutations in  <e1> BUD3 </e1> , BUD4, and  <e2> AXL1 </e2>  cause a and alpha cells to exhibit the bipolar pattern, indicating that these genes are necessary to specify the axial budding pattern (Chant, J., and I.

True	Two cDNAs, isolated from a Xenopus laevis embryonic library, encode proteins of 168 amino acids, both of which are 77% identical to chick  <e1> cofilin </e1>  and 66% identical to chick actin-depolymerizing factor ( <e2> ADF </e2> ), two structurally and functionally related proteins.
False	Although talin has been suggested to act as a linkage protein mediating the attachment of GPIIb-IIIa to  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments, direct binding of  <e2> GPIIb </e2> -IIIa to this cytoskeletal protein has not been demonstrated.
False	Most of these integrins, with their intracellular domains, interact with the actin-containing cytoskeleton, via linking proteins such as  <e1> vinculin </e1>  and  <e2> talin </e2> , while one of them interacts with the keratin filaments, via an as yet unknown linking molecule(s).
False	In this study, the expressions of smooth muscle-specific proteins (desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin,  <e1> basic calponin </e1>  and the smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain isoforms of  <e2> SM1 </e2>  and SM2) in three parent and four cloned neuroblastoma cell lines, composed of S-type cells, were examined by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
False	Compared with control and contralateral kidneys, the ligated kidneys displayed a dynamic expression of mRNAs for many apoptosis-related molecules, which included an up to threefold increase for Fas, Fas ligand,  <e1> TNF-R1 </e1> ,  <e2> TRAIL </e2> , TRADD, RIP, and caspase-8, and an up to twofold increase for FADD and FAP, but there was little change for FAF.
True	The p120cas gene encodes a protein tyrosine kinase substrate that associates with the cell-cell adhesion protein complex containing  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  and its cytoplasmic cofactors alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and  <e2> plakoglobin </e2> .
False	We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression, Ki-67 labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.
False	beta-catenin or  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton.

False	We show that the HSV-1 UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> , UL29,  <e2> UL30 </e2> , UL42, and UL52 gene products along with the AAV Rep68 protein are sufficient to initiate replication on duplex DNA containing the AAV origins of replication, resulting in products several hundred nucleotides in length.

Kovar et al. (2000) Plant J 24:625-636].
False	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all  <e1> myosin heavy chains </e1> , and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated  <e2> actin </e2> -dependent MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium myosin II requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2,  <e1> BNI1 </e1> , DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and  <e2> DFG16 </e2> , mutations that block filamentous growth.

False	One mutation, sac6-69, is in the gene encoding  <e1> fimbrin </e1> , another actin-binding protein, which was expected because null mutations in SAC6 and  <e2> CAP2 </e2>  are known to be synthetic-lethal.
True	Inactivation of the  <e1> Rb </e1>  pathway in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) occurs mostly through inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e2> p16 </e2> (INK4A) and/or up-regulation of cyclin D1.
False	Effects of profilin-annexin I association on some properties of both profilin and annexin I: modification of the inhibitory activity of profilin on  <e1> actin </e1>  polymerization and inhibition of the self-association of  <e2> annexin I </e2>  and its interactions with liposomes.

False	Study of mutated yeast  <e1> profilins </e1>  and  <e2> profilins </e2>  from Acanthamoeba suggests that the ability of profilin to suppress cap- cells is dependent upon a property other than, or in addition to, its ability to bind actin.
False	Glutathione S-transferase pull-down performed with Tax deletion mutants and peptide competition have localized the site in Tax critical for binding CBP/p300 to a highly protease-sensitive region around amino acid residues 81 to 95 (81QRTSKTLKVLTPPIT95) which lies between the domains previously proposed to be important for  <e1> CREB </e1>  binding and  <e2> Tax </e2>  subunit dimerization.

False	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous myogenin and  <e1> myosin light chain 2 </e1>  gene but not the endogenous MyoD1, MRF4, Myf5, the  <e2> skeletal muscle actin </e2> , or the myosin heavy chain genes.
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 versus acetylation of  <e2> histone </e2>  H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

True	The Tetrahymena  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  has two  <e2> actin </e2> -binding domains, but lacks the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding motif, suggesting that Tetrahymena fimbrin probably cross-links actin filaments in a Ca(2+)- insensitive manner during cytokinesis.

False	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal  <e1> actin </e1>  filament dynamics and  <e2> actin </e2>  bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with talin, another actin and vinculin-binding protein from focal adhesions.
False	The viscoelasticity of entangled actin networks: the influence of defects and modulation by  <e1> talin </e1>  and  <e2> vinculin </e2> .

False	We describe the localization of  <e1> cadherin-11 </e1>  and  <e2> N-cadherin </e2>  along the cell margins of mouse osteoblast-like cells, the colocalization of "pancadherin" with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, p120, and vinculin, and the association of these complexes with the actin microfilaments.
True	For example, it is associated with alpha-catenin and beta-catenin ( <e1> Armadillo </e1> ), and protected from trypsin digestion only in the presence of Ca2+, as is the case for many of classic  <e2> cadherins </e2> .

False	Here we describe the TNF-dependent activation of acid SMase ( <e1> A-SMase </e1> ) through the p55  <e2> TNF receptor </e2> -associated proteins TRADD and FADD.
True	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and  <e1> PIP kinases </e1>  and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with  <e2> actin-binding proteins </e2>  such as gelsolin and profilin.
True	A highly significant correlation was observed between the loss of expression of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin and gamma-catenin, but not  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , with increased TNM stage (p <0.05).

False	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous myogenin and  <e1> myosin light chain 2 </e1>  gene but not the endogenous MyoD1, MRF4,  <e2> Myf5 </e2> , the skeletal muscle actin, or the myosin heavy chain genes.
True	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p27( <e2> KIP1 </e2> ) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.

False	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of  <e1> profilin </e1>  and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	In this work we report that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD9,  <e1> RAD24 </e1> , RAD17,  <e2> MEC1 </e2> , MEC3 and RAD53 checkpoint genes are required for efficient non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

False	The differential localization of the three actin monomer-binding proteins suggests that they have different biologic functions in Acanthamoeba and is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) profilin I functions predominantly as an  <e1> actin </e1>  monomer-binding protein; (2)  <e2> profilin II </e2>  regulates, or is regulated by, PIP2; and (3) actobindin inhibits nucleation of new filaments and facilitates elongation of existing polarized filaments in actively motile regions.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38  <e1> MAPK </e1> , may be involved in the  <e2> muscarinic receptor </e2> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than  <e2> muscle actin </e2> ; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
True	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3;  <e1> histones </e1>   <e2> H2A </e2>  and H2B show less heterogeneity.
True	Although binding patterns of different sera were not identical, almost all sera caused  <e1> IgG </e1>  binding to platelet components of 87-90 kD, 140 kD (identified as  <e2> vinculin </e2> ) and 220-240 kD (tentatively identified as talin and actin-binding protein).

True	To our knowledge,  <e1> AF-6 </e1>  is the only integral component in cell-cell junctions discovered thus far that interacts with profilin and thus could modulate  <e2> actin </e2>  modeling proximal to adhesion complexes.
True	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae  <e1> DDC1 </e1>  gene belongs to the  <e2> RAD17 </e2> , MEC3 and RAD24 epistasis group which, together with RAD9, is proposed to act at the beginning of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway.
False	Expression of c-Myc or  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1>  was sufficient to activate cyclin E-Cdk2 by promoting the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes lacking the  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2>  p21, as has been described, following estrogen treatment.

True	These results show that the C-terminal  <e1> actin </e1> -binding site is distinct from the region recognized by the anti-functional antibody TD77, raising the possibility that it binds to a novel functionally important ligand-binding site in the  <e2> talin </e2>  molecule.
False	P-cadherin expression is a better indicator of clinical outcome than alterations in the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , or  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as  <e1> gelsolin </e1>  and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of  <e1> MKK1 </e1>  (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as  <e2> ROM2 </e2> , RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	We have characterized this  <e1> actin </e1>  with respect to its ability to interact with yeast  <e2> profilin </e2>  and tropomyosin, the only yeast actin-binding proteins so far purified and characterized.

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase,  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous  <e2> acetylase(s) </e2> .
False	Adherens junction proteins (N-cadherin,  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , plakoglobin, and actin) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were localized in the cultures by fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro wound healing was compared.

False	In this study, the expressions of smooth muscle-specific proteins (desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, basic calponin and the smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain isoforms of SM1 and  <e1> SM2 </e1> ) in three parent and four cloned neuroblastoma cell lines, composed of S-type cells, were examined by indirect immunofluorescence, Western blot and/or by reverse transcription- <e2> polymerase </e2>  chain reaction (RT-PCR).
False	Under all conditions, platelets retained 40-50% of their total  <e1> actin </e1>  and greater than 70% of their actin-binding protein (ABP) but lost greater than 80% of talin and  <e2> myosin </e2>  to the supernatant.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A,  <e1> H2B </e1> , H3, and  <e2> H4 </e2> , are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	In this model, profilin can bind both to  <e1> actin </e1>  monomers with a Kd of about 5 microM and to the barbed end of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments with a Kd of about 50-100 microM.

False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large  <e1> p <e2> rotein </e1>  </e2>  (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210, L: 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.
False	Recently it has been established, through a detailed biochemical analysis, that recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana  <e1> fimbrin 1 </e1>  ( <e2> AtFim1 </e2> ) is a member of the fimbrin/plastin family of actin filament bundling or cross-linking proteins [D.R. Kovar et al. (2000) Plant J 24:625-636].
False	Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and  <e1> Cdk4 </e1>  can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the p16(INK4a)  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2> .
True	Membranous staining and concomitant cytoplasmic localization of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> ,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  and gamma-catenin were seen in one case with abnormal beta-catenin immunoreactivity.
True	One such protein is the yeast  <e1> actin-binding protein </e1>   <e2> Sac6p </e2> , which is homologous to vertebrate fimbrin (Adams, A. E. M., D. Botstein, and D. G. Drubin. 1991. Nature (Lond.). 354:404-408.).
False	Because histone H3 shares many structural features with histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  and is intimately associated with H4 in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether  <e2> H3 </e2>  has similar functions.
False	With  <e1> profilins </e1> , whose sequestering activity was low, the concentration of free  <e2> actin </e2>  monomers observed at steady-state of polymerization [Afree], was close to that seen with actin alone ([Acc], critical concentration of polymerization).
True	Data is presented to suggest that the G1 cyclin D1 and the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>   <e2> p27KIP1 </e2>  may be involved in subversion of the G1/S traverse by signaling pathways activated by HER-2 function.
False	Impact of  <e1> profilin </e1>  on  <e2> actin </e2> -bound nucleotide exchange and actin polymerization dynamics.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of  <e1> MKK1 </e1>  (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed  <e2> glc7-10 </e2>  effectively.
False	To study profilin function, we extensively mutagenized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae  <e1> profilin </e1>  gene ( <e2> PFY1 </e2> ) and examined the consequences of specific point mutations on growth and actin organization.
False	Other mammalian actin-binding proteins such as profilin and CapG but also fragmin from Physarum polycephalum are similar targets for PIP2-stimulated  <e1> pp60 </e1> ( <e2> c-src </e2> ) phosphorylation.

True	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal actin filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with  <e1> talin </e1> , another actin and  <e2> vinculin </e2> -binding protein from focal adhesions.
False	These separately encoded a complete HPIV3 genome (negative-sense), the HPIV3 nucleocapsid protein  <e1> N </e1> , the phosphoprotein  <e2> P </e2> , and the polymerase protein L.

True	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in  <e1> p27 </e1> (KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in  <e2> cyclin E-associated kinase </e2>  activity.

True	The  <e1> Arp2 </e1> /3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin, consists of seven polypeptides; two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and  <e2> Arp3 </e2> ; and five apparently novel proteins, p40, p35, p19, p18, and p14 (Machesky et al., 1994).
False	These histone  <e1> H3 </e1>  and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and  <e2> H2a </e2>  mRNA, whereas the histone H4 and histone H2b genes encode < 10% of the total H4 and H2b mRNA.
True	Gravin is not likely to be a nonerythroid spectrin, talin,  <e1> myosin </e1> , or actin-binding protein based on the lack of reactivity of  <e2> antigravin </e2>  with these polypeptides in immunoblots.
True	The head domain of  <e1> talin </e1>  thus binds to  <e2> integrins </e2>  to form a link to the actin cytoskeleton and can thus regulate integrin function.
True	Recombinant  <e1> HSH49 </e1>  protein has a general RNA-binding activity that does not require  <e2> CUS1 </e2> .
True	Because both proteins exchange rapidly between actin molecules, low concentrations of  <e1> profilin </e1>  can overcome the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of  <e2> thymosin beta 4 </e2>  on the nucleotide exchange.
False	Abnormal immunoreactivity in the tumor tissue was observed in 18 patients (34.0%) for E-cadherin, in 35 (66.0%) for  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , in 20 (37.7%) for  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , and in 37 (69.8%) for gamma-catenin.

True	Our results showed that cell morphology, cell adhesion pattern, actin organization, and distribution of integrin subunits, talin,  <e1> vinculin </e1> , and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins are dependent on the supramolecular organization of the  <e2> collagens </e2> .
True	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like  <e1> beta 1-syntrophin </e1> , both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin,  <e2> utrophin </e2> /dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.
False	The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , whereas the binding of  <e2> gamma-catenin </e2>  (plakoglobin) to E-cadherin is less efficient.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as  <e1> ROM2 </e1> , RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and  <e2> MID2 </e2>  also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.

False	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p21 </e1> ( <e2> WAF1 </e2> /CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase (Pol) delta in the conversion reaction.
True	In these investigations, we determine that recruitment of a coactivator protein, CBP (the CREBbinding protein), to the CYBB or  <e1> NCF2 </e1>  promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by  <e2> PU.1 </e2> , IRF1, and ICSBP.
False	In the basal layer, patches of brightly labeled cells were detected with antibodies to E-cadherin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , and gamma-catenin, but not with antibodies to P-cadherin,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , or with pan-desmocollin and pan-desmoglein antibodies.

True	The  <e1> RAD51 </e1> -interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  protein shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 is species-specific.
True	Reversible binding of  <e1> actin </e1>  to  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  and profilin in human platelet extracts.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where  <e1> N </e1>  is the  <e2> nucleocapsid protein </e2>  gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
True	In higher plants, a large number of isoforms for the  <e1> actin </e1>  monomer-binding protein  <e2> profilin </e2>  have been identified, whereas other organisms express only few profilins.
False	Bud-site selection directs both cell polarity and the cytoskeletal orientation during budding and is determined by at least five genes: BUD1/ <e1> RSR1 </e1> , BUD2, BUD3, BUD4 and  <e2> BUD5 </e2> .
False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein ( <e1> NP </e1> ) and  <e2> phosphoprotein </e2>  (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein (M) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.
True	We have shown that the FH proteins  <e1> Bni1p </e1>  and Bnr1p are potential targets of the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins and bind to an actin-binding protein, profilin, at their proline-rich FH1 domains to regulate reorganization of the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
False	The results indicate that (a) plakoglobin and  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with LEF-1 and vinculin; (b) LEF-1-dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> ; and (c) the cytoplasmic partners of beta-catenin, cadherin and alpha-catenin, can sequester it to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity.
True	Semiserial sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), desmin and  <e1> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain </e1>  isoforms: SM1,  <e2> SM2 </e2>  and SMemb.
False	After in vitro labelling of isolated rat liver nuclei, the following ADP-ribosylated and unmodified histones were identified by HPLC and gel electrophoresis: histone H1(0), four histone H1 subfractions, histone H2A.1, histone H2A.2, oxidized  <e1> histone </e1>  H2A.2, histone H2A.X, histone H2A.Z, histone H2B, three histone  <e2> H3 </e2>  variants and histone H4.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 ( <e1> MEK </e1> ) or MPK1 ( <e2> MAP kinase </e2> ) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	The APC binding site on beta-catenin may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with  <e1> APC </e1> , although the amino-terminal half independently binds  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> .
True	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all myosin heavy chains, and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated  <e1> actin </e1> -dependent MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium  <e2> myosin II </e2>  requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.
False	Expression of c-Myc or cyclin D1 was sufficient to activate cyclin E- <e1> Cdk2 </e1>  by promoting the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes lacking the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e2> p21 </e2> , as has been described, following estrogen treatment.
False	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether other  <e1> glycoprotein 130 </e1>  ( <e2> gp130 </e2> ) binding cytokines can mimic the effects of oncostatin M (OSM) in acting synergistically with interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) to induce cartilage collagen breakdown and collagenase expression, and to determine which receptors mediate these effects.
True	The involvement of the death adaptor proteins FADD/MORT1, TRADD, and RIP and the apoptosis-initiating caspases-8 and  <e1> -10 </e1>  in death signaling by the two death-inducing TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 ( <e2> TRAIL-R1 </e2>  and TRAIL-R2) are controversial.
False	Since our earlier studies of Acanthamoeba  <e1> profilins </e1>  suggested the importance of PIP2 binding for suppression, we conclude that both activities are implicated and that an interplay between PIP2 binding and actin binding may be important for  <e2> profilin </e2>  function.
False	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of ActA binds one actin monomer, in a profilin-like fashion, and Arp2/ <e1> 3 </e1>  complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of  <e2> WASp </e2>  family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by Arp2/3 complex.
True	In their cytoplasmic region, some of these receptors share a conserved sequence motif - the 'death domain' - which is required for transduction of the apoptotic signal by recruiting other death-domain-containing adaptor molecules like the  <e1> Fas </e1> -associated protein  <e2> FADD </e2> /MORT1 or the TNF receptor-associated protein TRADD [2-4].
False	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins, UL5, UL8,  <e1> UL9 </e1> , UL42, UL52,  <e2> SSB </e2> , and Pol, that are essential for viral DNA replication.
False	The activation of the c-Raf-1-BxB- <e1> ER </e1>  protein leads to an accumulation of high levels of cyclin D1 protein and a repression of the p27Kip1  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2>  under all culture conditions tested.
False	A null mutation of the  <e1> actin </e1>  gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin (TPM1), fimbrin (SAC6),  <e2> Abp1p </e2>  (ABP1), and capping protein (CAP1 and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.
False	Specific antibodies to myosin heavy chain isoforms (SM1, SM2,  <e1> SMemb </e1> ), caldesmon, and alpha-smooth muscle actin and cDNAs for  <e2> SMemb </e2>  were used.

True	Within 1 hour of raising the concentration of calcium ions,  <e1> integrins </e1> , cadherins, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, plakoglobin, vinculin and alpha-actinin appeared to accumulate at cell-cell borders, whereas the focal contact proteins, paxillin and  <e2> talin </e2> , did not.

False	The assembly of complete HSV replication compartments and incorporation of BrdU were both abolished by treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and by omission of any one of the seven viral replication proteins,  <e1> UL5 </e1> , UL8, UL9, UL42, UL52,  <e2> SSB </e2> , and Pol, that are essential for viral DNA replication.
False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and  <e1> large p <e2> rotein </e1>  </e2>  (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210, L: 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.

False	In the ADE2 assay system, silencing depends completely upon the function of the  <e1> SIR </e1>  genes, known trans-acting regulators of the silent loci, and is sensitive to the gene dosage of two SIR genes, SIR1 and  <e2> SIR4 </e2> .
False	Mutations that alter putative RNA-binding residues of either HSH49 RRM are lethal in vivo, but do not prevent binding to  <e1> CUS1 </e1>  in vitro, suggesting that the predicted RNA-binding surfaces of  <e2> HSH49 </e2>  are not required for interaction with CUS1.
False	WASp contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase CDC42Hs as well as verprolin/ <e1> cofilin </e1> -like  <e2> actin </e2> -regulatory domains, but no specific actin structure regulated by CDC42Hs-WASp has been identified.
True	Fluorescent  <e1> actin </e1>  analogs with a high affinity for  <e2> profilin </e2>  in vitro exhibit an enhanced gradient of assembly in living cells.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via  <e1> mitogen-activated protein kinase </e1>  ( <e2> MAPK </e2> )/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
False	We show that the HSV-1  <e1> UL5 </e1> , UL8,  <e2> UL29 </e2> , UL30, UL42, and UL52 gene products along with the AAV Rep68 protein are sufficient to initiate replication on duplex DNA containing the AAV origins of replication, resulting in products several hundred nucleotides in length.

False	A null mutation of the actin gene (ACT1) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin (TPM1),  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  ( <e2> SAC6 </e2> ), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein (CAP1 and CAP2) genes have relatively mild or no effects.
False	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of  <e1> Ras </e1>  with Myc allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( <e2> CKI </e2> ).
True	One, MORT1 (also called FADD), binds to Fas/APO1 but not to p55-R; another,  <e1> TRADD </e1> , binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to Fas/ <e2> APO1 </e2> ; and the third, RIP, binds weakly to both receptors.
False	The Src homology domain 3 (SH3) of a yeast type I myosin,  <e1> Myo5p </e1> , binds to verprolin and is required for targeting to sites of  <e2> actin </e2>  polarization.
False	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p21 </e1> (WAF1/CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase ( <e2> Pol </e2> ) delta in the conversion reaction.

False	Although profilin released  <e1> actin </e1>  at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized  <e2> actin </e2>  content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
False	Immunohistochemistry for a variety of cytokeratins (CKs) (8/ <e1> 18 </e1> , 1/10, 7, and 20), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, vimentin CD34, type IV collagen,  <e2> smooth muscle actin </e2> , smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and glial fibrillary acid protein was performed.

True	The sites on the  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  that interact with  <e2> actin </e2>  and are responsible for force generation are ill-defined: crosslinking and experiments with isolated domains of the myosin head implicate regions in both the 50K and 20K (molecular weights in thousands) domains of the myosin head (subfragment 1, S1) in this process.

True	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and  <e1> c-Jun N-terminal kinase </e1> , but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <e2> IL-2 </e2>  production.
True	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the  <e1> cadherin </e1> /catenin complex to the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton.

False	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified  <e1> actin </e1>  explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled  <e2> actin </e2>  in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.
True	Although neither activation of  <e1> BCK1 </e1>  ( <e2> MEKK </e2> ) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of  <e1> PLC-delta </e1> , which leads to  <e2> actin </e2> -related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin, APC, and Tcf-4, which bind to the armadillo repeats of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  in the nucleus.

True	Here, we have detected a polypeptide in rat rod outer segments that is recognized by myosin heavy chain antibodies and was found to possess other characteristics of conventional  <e1> non-muscle myosin heavy chain </e1> : it comigrates in SDS-PAGE with non-muscle myosin heavy chain; it associates with the cytoskeleton of rod outer segments in an ATP-sensitive manner; and it binds to purified  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments in the absence of ATP.
False	Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies showed profilin I to be distributed throughout the Acanthamoeba cytoplasm, except for lamellipodia, with the highest fluorescence intensity in cortical regions in which monomeric  <e1> actin </e1>  also was present, as shown by labeling with fluorescent  <e2> DNase </e2> .
