False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or  <e1> MPK1 </e1>  (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and  <e2> MID2 </e2>  also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.

False	From these observations it is concluded that (i) RAD52 is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  and RAD52 have different functions, or that RAD52 has functions in addition to those of the  <e2> Rad51 </e2> /Rad52 protein complex.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant  <e1> BCK1-20 </e1>  mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or  <e2> MPK1 </e2>  (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.

True	This model includes two different Kd's--one for  <e1> profilin </e1>  bound to  <e2> actin </e2>  monomers and one for profilin bound to an actin molecule at the barbed end of a filament.
False	In the basal layer, patches of brightly labeled cells were detected with antibodies to E-cadherin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , and gamma-catenin, but not with antibodies to P-cadherin, alpha-catenin, or with pan-desmocollin and  <e2> pan-desmoglein </e2>  antibodies.

False	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative PCAF substrates,  <e1> histones </e1>  H3 and H4 and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 is significantly preferred over the histone H4 and p53 substrates.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule);  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	These proteins each have a  <e1> verprolin </e1> -homology (V) domain, cofilin-homology (C) domain and an acidic (A) region at the C-terminus, through which they activate the Arp2/3 complex, leading to rapid  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization.
False	Using ITP (a substrate for myosin II  <e1> ATPase </e1> ) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for myosin II heavy-chain kinase [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the actin network, a result that suggests that  <e2> MHCK </e2>  was localized at the foci.
False	Although both receptors are involved in M21 and H2981 cell adhesion to vitronectin, only a alpha v beta 3 can be detected in focal contacts, colocalizing with  <e1> vinculin </e1> ,  <e2> talin </e2> , and the ends of actin filaments, while alpha v beta 5 shows a distinct, nonfocal contact, distribution on the cell surface.

False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to  <e1> actin </e1>  in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization.

False	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative PCAF substrates, histones H3 and H4 and the transcription factor  <e1> p53 </e1> , and have determined that  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 is significantly preferred over the histone H4 and p53 substrates.

False	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> / <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.
False	To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for  <e1> Fas </e1> , Fas ligand, TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , RIP, FAF, FAP, and caspase-8.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of  <e1> MKK1 </e1>  (MEK) or  <e2> MPK1 </e2>  (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	A LIMK2 mutant with replacement of threonine 505 by valine abolished  <e1> LIMK2 </e1>  activities for cofilin phosphorylation and  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeletal changes, whereas replacement by glutamate enhanced the protein kinase activity and stress fiber formation by LIMK2.
False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin, APC, and  <e1> Tcf-4 </e1> , which bind to the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.

False	We report here that tropomyosin, which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the  <e1> villin </e1>  and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect actin binding by 110-kD  <e2> calmodulin </e2> .
False	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal actin filament dynamics and  <e1> actin </e1>  bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with talin, another actin and  <e2> vinculin </e2> -binding protein from focal adhesions.

False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that  <e1> histone </e1>  H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the  <e2> SAGA </e2>  complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

True	Kinetic measurements indicate that  <e1> profilin </e1>  binding to actin weakens the affinity of  <e2> actin </e2>  for nucleotides primarily due to an increased nucleotide dissociation rate constant, but the nucleotide association rate constant is also increased about 2-fold.
True	Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and  <e1> Cdk4 </e1>  can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an E2F-dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the  <e2> p16 </e2> (INK4a) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.
False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of  <e1> FLICE </e1> , Fas, FADD,  <e2> DR3 </e2> , FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

False	The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that cofilin binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to  <e1> actin </e1>  monomer in the filament and that  <e2> cofilin </e2>  increases the monomeric actin to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.
True	Testicular protein kinase 1 ( <e1> TESK1 </e1> ) is a serine/threonine kinase highly expressed in testicular germ cells and has the potential to phosphorylate  <e2> cofilin </e2>  and induce actin cytoskeletal reorganization.
True	Since both  <e1> caldesmon </e1>  and  <e2> profilin </e2>  have been found enriched in ruffling membranes of animal cells, our in vitro findings may be relevant to the regulation of actin filaments in living cells.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3,  <e1> RAD53 </e1> , CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17,  <e2> RAD24 </e2> , BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.
False	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the amino terminus of  <e1> alpha-catenin 57-264 </e1>  behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  binding disrupts the alpha-catenin dimer.
True	pH control of  <e1> actin </e1>  polymerization by  <e2> cofilin </e2> .
False	The proximity of these sites to the  <e1> actin </e1>  binding site provides an explanation for the competition between  <e2> actin </e2>  and lipids for binding profilin.
False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2  <e1> rad54 </e1>  and  <e2> srs2 </e2>  rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.

False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1,  <e1> DBR1 </e1> , CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and  <e2> DFG16 </e2> , mutations that block filamentous growth.

False	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that  <e1> vinculin </e1>  has a negligible influence on internal actin filament dynamics and actin bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with talin, another actin and  <e2> vinculin </e2> -binding protein from focal adhesions.
False	In vitro studies indicated that suramin completely blocked  <e1> PDGF receptor </e1>  activation or phosphorylation stimulated by PDGF-AB, inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) kinases (MEK1/ <e2> 2 </e2> ) and ERK1/2, and abrogated transcription factor AP-1 DNA-binding activity.
True	Within 1 hour of raising the concentration of calcium ions, integrins, cadherins,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , beta-catenin, plakoglobin, vinculin and alpha-actinin appeared to accumulate at cell-cell borders, whereas the focal contact proteins,  <e2> paxillin </e2>  and talin, did not.
False	 <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/ <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

False	The assay detects the high-affinity binding of actin to  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1>  (ABPs), cofilin or  <e2> DNase I </e2> .
False	We found that the down-regulation of E-cad, alpha-catenin, and  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  expression significantly correlated with tumor high grade, but not with vascular invasion, metastasis, p53 expression,  <e2> Ki-67 </e2>  labeling, or c-erbB2 expression, except for beta-catenin, the down-regulation of which was associated with c-erbB2 down-regulation.
False	PDGF treatment had no effect on talin, vimentin, or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml  <e1> epidermal growth factor </e1>  (EGF), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on  <e2> vinculin </e2>  or actin distribution.
True	The aim of our study on human seminiferous tubules of adolescent testes was to study the localization of two  <e1> actin </e1> -associated proteins of the adherens junctions, such as vinculin and  <e2> talin </e2> , and to verify if there were modifications in their pattern in varicocele, a frequent disease of the testis in adolescent age.

False	Neuropilin 1 (NP-1) is a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor ( <e1> VEGF </e1> )  <e2> 165 </e2>  (VEGF165) and acts as a coreceptor that enhances VEGF165 function through tyrosine kinase VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2).
True	Expression of c-Myc or  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1>  was sufficient to activate  <e2> cyclin E </e2> -Cdk2 by promoting the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes lacking the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, as has been described, following estrogen treatment.

False	In the present paper, using indirect immunofluorescence, we found that PMN adhesion to tumor necrosis factor-activated endothelial cells (EC) induced the disappearance from endothelial cell-to-cell contacts of adherens junction (AJ) components: vascular endothelial (VE)- <e1> cadherin </e1> ,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , beta-catenin, and plakoglobin.
False	Here, we show that the x-ray sensitivity of  <e1> rad55 </e1>  and  <e2> rad57 </e2>  mutant strains is suppressible by overexpression of RAD51 or RAD52.

True	The majority of the aromatic residues in  <e1> profilin </e1>  are exposed to solvent and lie in either of two hydrophobic patches, neither of which takes part in an interface with  <e2> actin </e2> .

False	The core, isolated in the absence of free Ca2+, contains five major proteins: the  <e1> actin </e1>  (Mr 43 000) that makes up the filaments, the  <e2> villin </e2>  (Mr 95 000) and fimbrin (Mr 68 000) that cross-link the filaments together, and the 110 000 Mr polypeptide-calmodulin complex that makes up cross-filaments which project laterally from the core and link it to the inner surface of the microvillus membrane.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N- <e1> 4a </e1> -4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and  <e2> 4b </e2>  are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.

True	Introduction of high concentrations of  <e1> profilin </e1>  (estimated injected intracellular concentration 11-22 microM) into infected PtK2 cells causes a marked slowing of  <e2> actin </e2>  tail elongation and bacterial migration.
True	Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes a helicase-primase that consists of the products of the  <e1> UL5 </e1> , UL8, and  <e2> UL52 </e2>  genes (Crute, J.

True	Herpes simplex virus type 1 encodes a heterotrimeric helicase-primase complex that is composed of the products of the UL5,  <e1> UL52 </e1> , and  <e2> UL8 </e2>  genes.
False	This result was supported by a high protein expression of the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p16 in 44% of the tumours with high cyclin E and low D1 expression, and all immunohistochemical pRB defect tumours showed a high  <e2> p16 </e2>  protein level.

True	These data indicated a negative co-operativity between the profilin and  <e1> DNase I </e1>  binding sites on  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	The core histones from Physarum,  <e1> histones </e1>  H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated;  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.

False	Even the Munc18-2 mutants that do not detectably bind  <e1> syntaxin 3 </e1>  were membrane associated in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the  <e2> syntaxin </e2>  interaction is not the sole determinant of Sec1 protein membrane attachment.
False	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative PCAF substrates, histones H3 and  <e1> H4 </e1>  and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that histone H3 is significantly preferred over the histone H4 and  <e2> p53 </e2>  substrates.

True	An assembly of the  <e1> UL5 </e1>  and  <e2> UL52 </e2>  subunits retains both enzymic activities, and the UL8 protein has been implicated in modulating these functions, facilitating efficient nuclear uptake of the complex and interacting with other viral DNA replication proteins.
False	Mutants of cdc3 and cdc8, which encode profilin and  <e1> tropomyosin </e1>  respectively, display disorganized  <e2> actin </e2>  patches in all cells.

False	No significant changes in glomerular  <e1> vinculin </e1> ,  <e2> talin </e2> , beta 1-integrin, or total actin expression occurred at any time point during disease development.
False	Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with  <e1> EGFR </e1>  were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the  <e2> EGFR </e2>  tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from E-cadherin was not.
False	To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules,  <e1> ribonuclease </e1>  protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for Fas,  <e2> Fas ligand </e2> , TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD, RIP, FAF, FAP, and caspase-8.

False	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate  <e1> actin </e1>  assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized  <e2> actin </e2>  associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
True	Kinetic measurements indicate that  <e1> profilin </e1>  binding to  <e2> actin </e2>  weakens the affinity of actin for nucleotides primarily due to an increased nucleotide dissociation rate constant, but the nucleotide association rate constant is also increased about 2-fold.
False	Panels of six to 31 MAbs against the haemagglutinin ( <e1> H </e1> ), fusion (F), nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M)  <e2> proteins </e2>  of MV and the H, F, NP and P proteins of CDV were employed.

False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <e1> IL-2 </e1>  production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via  <e2> mitogen-activated protein kinase </e2>  (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
False	MC159 and E8 inhibited both  <e1> TNFR-1 </e1> - and  <e2> CD-95 </e2> -induced apoptosis as well as killing mediated by overexpression of the downstream adaptors TRADD and FADD.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  <e1> RFC5 </e1> , DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and  <e2> MAD3 </e2>  had little effect.
False	Since  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  is required for cadherin-mediated adhesion, the armadillo repeat region alone probably cannot promote cell adhesion, making it unlikely that  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  induces axis duplication by increasing cell adhesion.
True	 <e1> Single-headed myosin </e1> , which consists of a full length  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  and a tagged tail, was isolated on the basis of the affinities for Nickel agarose and actin.

True	Role of  <e1> cofilin </e1>  in epidermal growth factor-stimulated  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization and lamellipod protrusion.
True	A chimera consisting of the alpha-catenin-binding region of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  linked to the amino terminus of  <e2> alpha-catenin 57-264 </e2>  behaves as a monomer in solution, as expected, since beta-catenin binding disrupts the alpha-catenin dimer.
False	This activity is independent of  <e1> FADD-DN </e1> 's ability to bind to three known interacting proteins, Fas, TRADD or RIP suggesting that it is distinct from  <e2> FADD </e2> 's functions at activated death receptors.
False	Armadillo ( <e1> Arm </e1> ) repeat 10 to the COOH terminus of beta-catenin is involved in binding to CBP, whereas beta-catenin interacts directly with the CREB-binding domain of  <e2> CBP </e2> .
False	In the present paper, using indirect immunofluorescence, we found that PMN adhesion to tumor necrosis factor-activated endothelial cells (EC) induced the disappearance from endothelial cell-to-cell contacts of adherens junction (AJ) components: vascular endothelial (VE)- <e1> cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and  <e2> plakoglobin </e2> .
True	Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of actin in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this  <e1> actin </e1>  may travel as a complex with actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
True	These results support a model in which  <e1> EGF </e1>  stimulation recruits  <e2> cofilin </e2>  to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short actin filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization.
False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large  <e1> p <e2> rotein </e1>  </e2>  (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210, L: 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.

False	Unexpectedly, treatment with the actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin-A disrupted the medial region targeting pattern, and cells deficient in the actin-binding proteins tropomyosin and  <e1> profilin </e1>  also did not exhibit medial  <e2> GFP </e2> -Cdc42p staining.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones  <e2> H2A </e2>  and H2B show less heterogeneity.

False	Analyses of dynamic light scattering data by stretched exponential fit show that vinculin has a negligible influence on internal actin filament dynamics and  <e1> actin </e1>  bending stiffness which contrasts with our previous observations with talin, another  <e2> actin </e2>  and vinculin-binding protein from focal adhesions.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A,  <e1> H2B </e1> , H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and  <e2> H2B </e2>  show less heterogeneity.

False	While levels of most of these proteins decrease, accumulation of cyclin D1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21  <e1> Cip1 </e1> / <e2> WAF1 </e2>  is observed.
False	Thus, both DR5 and DR4 use  <e1> FADD </e1> ,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and FADD is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.

False	Immunohistochemical studies showed a strong reactivity of most LAM cells for  <e1> alpha-smooth muscle actin </e1>  and  <e2> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain </e2>  and a weak to moderate reactivity of a lesser number of cells for desmin and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-B.
False	In contrast, overexpression of the  <e1> profilin </e1>  gene,  <e2> PFY1 </e2> , encoding an actin-binding protein, leads to no very obvious phenotype.
False	The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , whereas the binding of gamma-catenin (plakoglobin) to  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  is less efficient.

False	Here, we have detected a polypeptide in rat rod outer segments that is recognized by  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  antibodies and was found to possess other characteristics of conventional non-muscle myosin heavy chain: it comigrates in SDS-PAGE with non-muscle myosin heavy chain; it associates with the cytoskeleton of rod outer segments in an ATP-sensitive manner; and it binds to purified  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments in the absence of ATP.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase ( <e1> MAPK </e1> )/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and  <e2> c-Jun N-terminal kinase </e2> , but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

False	beta-catenin, but not  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , p120( <e2> cas </e2> ) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.

True	Phosphorylation of the headpiece domain could regulate the  <e1> actin </e1>  binding and bundling properties of  <e2> fimbrin </e2> , or it could regulate the interaction of fimbrin with other proteins.
False	Newly disclosed interactions between gephyrin, exchange factors for G proteins of the Rho and Rac families, the translational regulator  <e1> RAFT1 </e1> , and actin-binding proteins like  <e2> profilin </e2>  might integrate activity-dependent and trophic-factor-mediated signals at developing postsynaptic sites.

True	We have shown that these proteins are indeed  <e1> nuclear basic proteins </e1> : the 14 kd is the histone H4, the 19 kd is the histone H3, and the 25 kd is the sperm-specific protein  <e2> SP2 </e2> .
True	These results support a model in which EGF stimulation recruits cofilin to the leading edge where its severing activity is activated, leading to the generation of short  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments with free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization.
False	Recent evidence that  <e1> profilin </e1>  inhibits phospholipase C and enhances nucleotide exchange of actin has led some to question whether profilin is ever truly an  <e2> actin </e2>  monomer sequestering agent.
False	In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry on sectioned  <e1> Myf-5 </e1>  and MyoD mutant embryos with antibodies reactive with desmin, nestin, myosin heavy chain, sarcomeric actin, Myf-5,  <e2> MyoD </e2>  and myogenin.

False	Dispersal of  <e1> profilin </e1>  from such sites by oligoproline-rich peptide inhibitors suggests that  <e2> profilin </e2>  is directly involved in intracellular pathogen locomotion and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton of the host cell peripheral membrane.
False	In this study the role of  <e1> MSH2 </e1> , MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and  <e2> MSH6 </e2>  proteins.

False	Immunoprecipitation with an E-cadherin mAb, which is known to co-precipitate the  <e1> catenins </e1> , demonstrated that the three poorly differentiated cell lines expressing E-cadherin did not co-precipitate alpha-catenin, although all of the moderately-well differentiated cell lines expressed both alpha- and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .
False	Under all conditions, platelets retained 40-50% of their total actin and greater than 70% of their actin-binding protein (ABP) but lost greater than 80% of  <e1> talin </e1>  and  <e2> myosin </e2>  to the supernatant.
True	Thus, both DR5 and  <e1> DR4 </e1>  use FADD,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and FADD is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.
True	Furthermore, this inactivating effect of calmodulin can be prevented by coexpressing a region of the cytoskeletal protein  <e1> alpha-actinin2 </e1>  known to interact with the CO region of  <e2> NR1 </e2> .
True	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via  <e1> p38 </e1>  MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <e2> IL-2 </e2>  production.
False	Although neither activation of  <e1> BCK1 </e1>  (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 ( <e2> MEK </e2> ) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	The affinity of yeast  <e1> profilin </e1>  for rabbit  <e2> actin </e2>  (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins.
False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and  <e1> srs2Delta </e1>  rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions  <e2> RAD9 </e2> , RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2 rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
False	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/ <e1> dystrophin related protein </e1> , and the Torpedo  <e2> 87K </e2>  protein.

False	 <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , but not E-cadherin, p120( <e2> cas </e2> ) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when proteasome-mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.
False	In this study we demonstrate that histone  <e1> H3 </e1>  and  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 synthesized in young (5 hr) conjugating Tetrahymena are deposited into micronuclei in acetylated forms.
False	Because other researchers have shown that the RAD51 and RAD52 proteins interact, RAD51 on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the  <e1> rad52-20 </e1>  allele, but RAD 54, 55 and  <e2> 57 </e2>  did not suppress.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3;  <e2> histones </e2>  H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	In most cases, ADF and  <e1> cofilin </e1>  colocalized in the same nuclear actin rods, but  <e2> ADF </e2>  appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1,  <e1> WHI3 </e1> ,  <e2> NAB1 </e2> , DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	We then compared colorectal cancers with 'mild' RER (n = 15), and those with 'severe' RER without (n = 11) or with (n = 22) detectable mutations in MSH2 or MLH1 to assess the involvement of mononucleotide repeats contained in the coding regions of  <e1> MSH3 </e1> ,  <e2> MSH6 </e2> , BAX, and TGFbeta RII.
False	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires  <e1> MSH2 </e1>  and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and  <e2> MSH6 </e2>  or MSH2 and MSH3.
True	Yeast  <e1> profilin </e1>  can sequester yeast actin monomers and thereby reduce the ability of yeast  <e2> actin </e2>  to polymerize, whereas it has little effect on the degree of polymerization of rabbit skeletal muscle actin.
True	BACKGROUND: p27( <e1> Kip1 </e1> ), a  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2> , negatively regulates the G1 phase progression of the cell cycle by binding to the cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complex.

True	 <e1> Profilins </e1>  also bind polyphosphoinositides, which can disrupt the profilin- <e2> actin </e2>  complex, and proline-rich ligands which localize profilin to sites requiring extensive actin filament accumulation.
False	Immunohistochemistry for a variety of cytokeratins ( <e1> CKs </e1> ) (8/18, 1/10, 7, and 20), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein,  <e2> vimentin </e2>  CD34, type IV collagen, smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and glial fibrillary acid protein was performed.

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 versus acetylation of histone  <e2> H3 </e2> : with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39,  <e1> STE12 </e1> , TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1,  <e2> CDC55 </e2> , SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.

False	By analytical ultracentrifugation, rhodamine-labeled profilin binds  <e1> Arp2 </e1> /3 complex with a Kd of 7 microM, an affinity intermediate between the low affinity of profilin for barbed ends of actin filaments and its high affinity for  <e2> actin </e2>  monomers.
False	Confluent calf pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers exposed to 95% oxygen for 1, 2, or 3 days exhibit a time-dependent increase in adherence to substratum, which closely parallels changes in actin cytoarchitecture and the distribution of focal contact proteins  <e1> vinculin </e1>  and  <e2> talin </e2> .
False	To test these models in living cells using imaging techniques, we prepared a new fluorescent analog of  <e1> actin </e1>  that bound profilin, a protein that interacts with phosphoinositides and  <e2> actin </e2> -monomers in a mutually exclusive manner, with an order of magnitude greater affinity (Kd = 3.6 microM) than cys-374-labeled actin (Kd > 30 microM), yet retained the ability to inhibit DNase I.

True	A  <e1> LIMK2 </e1>  mutant with replacement of threonine 505 by valine abolished LIMK2 activities for  <e2> cofilin </e2>  phosphorylation and actin cytoskeletal changes, whereas replacement by glutamate enhanced the protein kinase activity and stress fiber formation by LIMK2.

True	The  <e1> tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 </e1>  (TNFR1) and the Fas receptor recruit complexes formed by the interactions between  <e2> RIP kinase </e2> , TRADD, FADD and RAIDD - adaptor proteins that contain death domains - which in turn recruit other proteins to initiate signaling [1][2][3][4][5].
False	 <e1> Gravin </e1>  is not likely to be a nonerythroid spectrin, talin, myosin, or  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2>  based on the lack of reactivity of antigravin with these polypeptides in immunoblots.

False	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate  <e1> actin </e1>  assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of  <e2> profilin </e2>  in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of actin released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ <e1> extracellular signal regulated protein kinase </e1>  and  <e2> c-Jun N-terminal kinase </e2> , but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
False	Study of mutated yeast profilins and  <e1> profilins </e1>  from Acanthamoeba suggests that the ability of  <e2> profilin </e2>  to suppress cap- cells is dependent upon a property other than, or in addition to, its ability to bind actin.

False	Although the chemical basis of these results is not known, they indicate that profilin can tightly sequester  <e1> actin </e1>  monomers and support the earlier suggestion that the affinity of profilin for  <e2> actin </e2>  may be under metabolic control.
False	To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for  <e1> Fas </e1> ,  <e2> Fas ligand </e2> , TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD, RIP, FAF, FAP, and caspase-8.
True	We report here that  <e1> tropomyosin </e1> , which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the villin and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect actin binding by 110-kD  <e2> calmodulin </e2> .

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as  <e1> ROM2 </e1> , RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/ <e2> SLG1 </e2>  and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	However, disassembly of the  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton using Latrunculin-A does not alter verprolin's location, indicating that verprolin establishes and maintains its location independent of the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton.
False	beta-catenin or  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> /plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/ <e1> waf1 </e1>  promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/ <e2> waf1 </e2>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.
True	 <e1> Death receptors </e1>  belong to the TNF receptor family and are characterised by an intracellular death domain that serves to recruit adapter proteins such as TRADD and FADD and  <e2> cysteine proteases </e2>  such as Caspase-8.

False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated;  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3;  <e2> histones </e2>  H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.

False	The findings suggest that M1  <e1> muscarinic receptors </e1>  are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via  <e2> p38 </e2>  MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
True	In most cases, ADF and  <e1> cofilin </e1>  colocalized in the same nuclear  <e2> actin </e2>  rods, but ADF appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.

True	Using the two-hybrid system, we show that  <e1> verprolin </e1>  binds  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	The ability of WIP to replace verprolin is dependent on its WH2  <e1> actin </e1>  binding domain and a putative  <e2> profilin </e2>  binding domain.

True	PF4-dependent downregulation of cyclin E-cdk2 activity was associated with increased binding of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor,  <e1> p21 </e1> (Cip1/WAF1), to the  <e2> cyclin E </e2> -cdk2 complex.
False	The influence of these collagens on cell morphology and the distribution pattern of  <e1> actin </e1> ,  <e2> vimentin </e2> , talin, and vinculin was analyzed by light microscopy, conventional electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and immunogold labeling after lysis-squirting.

False	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires MSH2 and MSH6, and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or  <e1> MSH2 </e1>  and  <e2> MSH3 </e2> .
True	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous  <e2> acetylase(s) </e2> .

True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous  <e1> p21 </e1> / <e2> waf1 </e2>  promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1( <e1> p55 </e1> ), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD, DR3,  <e2> FAF </e2> , TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

True	While poly(ADP-ribose) effectively competed with DNA for binding of  <e1> histone </e1>   <e2> H4 </e2> , it equally competed with DNA for binding of histone H3 and only inefficiently competed with DNA for binding of histone H1.
True	Here, we show that EID-1 is a potent inhibitor of differentiation and link this activity to its ability to inhibit p300 (and the highly related molecule,  <e1> CREB-binding protein </e1> , or CBP)  <e2> histone </e2>  acetylation activity.

False	The results indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair: one that recognized single-base mispairs and requires  <e1> MSH2 </e1>  and  <e2> MSH6 </e2> , and a second that recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs and requires a combination of either MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3.
False	Surprisingly, although maintained in mitogen-rich medium, this ectopic expression was associated with a transactivation of the endogenous  <e1> myogenin </e1>  and myosin light chain 2 gene but not the endogenous MyoD1,  <e2> MRF4 </e2> , Myf5, the skeletal muscle actin, or the myosin heavy chain genes.

False	 <e1> Profilin </e1>  is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and  <e2> actin </e2>  raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism.
False	Unexpectedly, treatment with the actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin-A disrupted the medial region targeting pattern, and cells deficient in the actin-binding proteins tropomyosin and  <e1> profilin </e1>  also did not exhibit medial GFP- <e2> Cdc42p </e2>  staining.

False	Our data indicate that even  <e1> profilins </e1>  of highly distant evolutionary origin can functionally substitute for each other and support the hypothesis that in animal cells,  <e2> profilins </e2>  are engaged in regulating either the stability or the kinetic properties of actin filaments.
False	These histone H3 and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and H2a mRNA, whereas the histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  and histone  <e2> H2b </e2>  genes encode < 10% of the total H4 and H2b mRNA.

False	Chick embryo fibroblasts contain about 75-100 microM unpolymerized actin and at least four proteins which can bind actin monomers, actin depolymerizing factor (ADF), gelsolin,  <e1> profilin </e1> , and  <e2> thymosin beta4 </e2>  (Tbeta4).
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone  <e1> H4 </e1>  (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of  <e2> histone </e2>  H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
True	In cultured cells,  <e1> cofilin </e1> , as well as ADF, translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus together with  <e2> actin </e2>  and forms rod-like structures in response to heat shock or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment.

False	Because histone  <e1> H3 </e1>  shares many structural features with histone H4 and is intimately associated with H4 in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether  <e2> H3 </e2>  has similar functions.
True	The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the  <e1> Munc18-2 </e1>  variants with syntaxin 3 correlated well with their ability to displace  <e2> SNAP-23 </e2>  from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells.
False	AIMS: To investigate the disturbance of intercellular adhesion in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), we examined the ultrastructural localization of  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  ( <e2> E-cad </e2> ), alpha-catenin (alpha-cat) and beta-catenin (beta-cat) in ACC, and compared it with that in the normal labial gland.
False	With solutions of actin (2 microM) and  <e1> thymosin-beta4 </e1>  (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing  <e2> profilin </e2>  concentration (0.7-2 microM).
False	From these observations it is concluded that (i) RAD52 is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that RAD51 and  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  have different functions, or that RAD52 has functions in addition to those of the Rad51/ <e2> Rad52 </e2>  protein complex.

True	Experiments performed using extracts from doubly infected cells indicated that  <e1> UL8 </e1>  could interact separately with both the  <e2> UL5 </e2>  and UL52 proteins.
False	Since alpha-catenin is required for  <e1> cadherin </e1> -mediated adhesion, the armadillo repeat region alone probably cannot promote cell adhesion, making it unlikely that  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  induces axis duplication by increasing cell adhesion.
False	To detect the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, ribonuclease protection assay was used with specific antisense RNA probes for Fas, Fas ligand, TNFR-1, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD, RIP,  <e1> FAF </e1> ,  <e2> FAP </e2> , and caspase-8.

False	The main inhibitory action of p27, a  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  (CDKI), arises from its binding with the cyclin E/ <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase 2 </e2>  (Cdk2) complex that results in G(1)-S arrest.
False	Aprotinin inhibited platelet aggregation induced by thrombin (0.25 U.ml-1) with IC50 200 kIU.ml-1, and inhibited the rise of cytosolic free calcium concentration in platelets stimulated by  <e1> thrombin </e1>  (0.1 U.ml-1) in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+ 0.5 mmol.L-1 (IC50 117 and 50 kIU.ml-1, respectively), but had no effect on the amounts of actin and  <e2> myosin heavy chain </e2>  associated with cytoskeletons.
False	Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind to the same region of  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , beta-catenin competed with the binding of plakoglobin to  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  and vice versa.
False	Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins with HECD-1 revealed three bands corresponding to E-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , and gamma-catenin and a 79-kDa band which was apparently smaller than that of normal  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , indicating truncated beta-catenin.
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone  <e1> H4 </e1> , and not histone  <e2> H3 </e2> , was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	Expression of  <e1> c-Myc </e1>  or  <e2> cyclin D1 </e2>  was sufficient to activate cyclin E-Cdk2 by promoting the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes lacking the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, as has been described, following estrogen treatment.
True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone  <e1> H4 </e1> , and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous  <e2> p21 </e2> /waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

False	The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid ( <e1> N </e1> ), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and  <e2> large protein </e2>  (L) genes were partly determined for 19 wild strains of measles virus (MV) isolated over the past 10 years in Japan (nucleotide position N: 1301-1700, P: 1751-2190, M: 3571-4057, F: 6621-7210, L: 10381-11133) and also for a MV strain obtained from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) who had natural measles in 1980.
False	Moreover, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 can stimulate the Brca1 promoter in an  <e1> E2F </e1> -dependent manner, and this is inhibited by coexpression of the  <e2> p16 </e2> (INK4a) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.

True	Within 1 hour of raising the concentration of calcium ions, integrins, cadherins, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, plakoglobin, vinculin and  <e1> alpha-actinin </e1>  appeared to accumulate at cell-cell borders, whereas the focal contact proteins,  <e2> paxillin </e2>  and talin, did not.
True	Unexpectedly, treatment with the actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin-A disrupted the medial region targeting pattern, and cells deficient in the  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1>   <e2> tropomyosin </e2>  and profilin also did not exhibit medial GFP-Cdc42p staining.
True	The verprolin-like central (vc) region of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein induces  <e1> Arp2 </e1> /3 complex-dependent  <e2> actin </e2>  nucleation.
True	Together these results indicate that TGFbeta regulates  <e1> clusterin </e1>  gene expression through an AP-1 site and its cognate transcription factor  <e2> AP-1 </e2> , and requires the involvement of protein kinase C.
False	Effects of profilin-annexin I association on some properties of both  <e1> profilin </e1>  and  <e2> annexin I </e2> : modification of the inhibitory activity of profilin on actin polymerization and inhibition of the self-association of annexin I and its interactions with liposomes.

True	In adherens junctions, the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins bind to  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , which in turn binds to the actin-associated protein  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> .
True	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to  <e1> cyclin D3 </e1> / <e2> CDK4 </e2> ).

True	The main inhibitory action of  <e1> p27 </e1> , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), arises from its binding with the  <e2> cyclin E </e2> /cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex that results in G(1)-S arrest.

False	Acanthamoeba actin and  <e1> profilin </e1>  can be cross-linked between glutamic acid 364 of  <e2> actin </e2>  and lysine 115 of profilin.
True	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1>  such as gelsolin and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
False	The Arp2/3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on  <e1> profilin </e1> , consists of seven polypeptides; two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3; and five apparently novel proteins, p40, p35, p19,  <e2> p18 </e2> , and p14 (Machesky et al., 1994).
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function;  <e1> M </e1>  is the proposed matrix protein gene;  <e2> G </e2>  is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE,  <e1> Fas </e1> , FADD, DR3,  <e2> FAF </e2> , TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
False	This suggests that dephosphorylation of cofilin and  <e1> destrin </e1> / <e2> ADF </e2>  by TSH could be implicated in the disruption of actin-containing stress fibers and in the reorganization of microfilaments induced by this hormone.
False	Unexpectedly, treatment with the  <e1> actin </e1> -depolymerizing drug latrunculin-A disrupted the medial region targeting pattern, and cells deficient in the actin-binding proteins tropomyosin and  <e2> profilin </e2>  also did not exhibit medial GFP-Cdc42p staining.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 ( <e1> MEKK </e1> ) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked  <e2> PKC1 </e2>  as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in  <e1> muscarinic receptor </e1> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ <e2> extracellular signal regulated protein kinase </e2>  and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

False	In the basal layer, patches of brightly labeled cells were detected with antibodies to E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and  <e1> gamma-catenin </e1> , but not with antibodies to P-cadherin, alpha-catenin, or with pan-desmocollin and  <e2> pan-desmoglein </e2>  antibodies.
False	Another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor,  <e1> p27KIP1 </e1> , and  <e2> cyclin D </e2>  increased slightly, whereas proliferating cell nuclear antigen and p130 remained unchanged.

False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions  <e1> RAD9 </e1> , RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the  <e2> srs2 </e2>  rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.

False	However, these rod structures were not observed in response to  <e1> TSH </e1> , forskolin, or TPA, suggesting that dephosphorylation of  <e2> cofilin </e2>  correlates with the reorganization of actin microfilaments but not with the nuclear transport of cofilin.

False	The observed in vivo expression patterns of  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> ,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , and plakoglobin suggest that these proteins are directly linked with the developmental regulation of cell junctions, as cardiac cells become stably committed and phenotypically differentiated to eventually form a mature myocardium.
False	The  <e1> Src </e1>  homology domain 3 (SH3) of a yeast  <e2> type I myosin </e2> , Myo5p, binds to verprolin and is required for targeting to sites of actin polarization.
True	In these investigations, we determine that recruitment of a coactivator protein,  <e1> CBP </e1>  (the CREBbinding protein), to the CYBB or  <e2> NCF2 </e2>  promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by PU.1, IRF1, and ICSBP.
False	The p120cas gene encodes a  <e1> protein tyrosine kinase </e1>  substrate that associates with the cell-cell adhesion protein complex containing E-cadherin and its cytoplasmic cofactors alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and  <e2> plakoglobin </e2> .

False	The presence of  <e1> filamin </e1>  in the cleavage furrows also suggests the possibility of an overlapping mechanism in addition to that of a talin mediated mechanism for the attachment of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments to the cell surfaces in the cleavage furrow.
False	While levels of most of these proteins decrease, accumulation of cyclin D1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p21 </e1>   <e2> Cip1 </e2> /WAF1 is observed.

True	The tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and the  <e1> Fas </e1>  receptor recruit complexes formed by the interactions between RIP kinase,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , FADD and RAIDD - adaptor proteins that contain death domains - which in turn recruit other proteins to initiate signaling [1][2][3][4][5].
True	The  <e1> Arp2 </e1> /3 complex, first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin, consists of seven polypeptides; two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3; and five apparently novel proteins, p40, p35,  <e2> p19 </e2> , p18, and p14 (Machesky et al., 1994).

False	WASp contains a binding motif for the  <e1> Rho GTPase </e1>  CDC42Hs as well as  <e2> verprolin </e2> /cofilin-like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific actin structure regulated by CDC42Hs-WASp has been identified.
False	The expression of  <e1> APC </e1> ,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  and beta-catenin also was decreased in HT29 cells, with a translocation of APC into the nucleus.

True	Detection of a sequence involved in  <e1> actin </e1> -binding and phosphoinositide-binding in the N-terminal side of  <e2> cofilin </e2> .

True	To investigate the possibility that  <e1> TD77 </e1>  disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional  <e2> talin </e2>  fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.

False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ <e1> extracellular signal regulated protein kinase </e1>  and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38  <e2> MAPK </e2> , may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

True	These results suggest that activation of  <e1> PKC </e1>  precedes the activation of PI and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with  <e2> actin-binding proteins </e2>  such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	They had altered adhesive properties as measured by their ability to bind to a  <e1> fibronectin </e1> -coated glass surface, suggesting that the expression of a rac-1 GAP alters the assembly of integrin receptors, actin and cytoskeletal proteins such as  <e2> vinculin </e2>  and talin.

False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of  <e1> FLICE </e1> , Fas,  <e2> FADD </e2> , DR3, FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
False	The higher affinity of vaccinia profilin for polyphosphoinositides (Kd = 0.2-8.5 microM) than for actin or poly(L-proline) and the concentration of vaccinia  <e1> profilin </e1>  expressed in infected HeLa cells (approximately 20 microM) suggest that vaccinia  <e2> profilin </e2>  binds preferentially to PIP and PIP2 in vivo.
False	We conclude that  <e1> Aip1p </e1>  is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts  <e2> cofilin </e2>  localization to cortical actin patches.
False	Membranous staining and concomitant cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  and gamma-catenin were seen in one case with abnormal  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  immunoreactivity.

False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein (NP) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and  <e1> membrane protein </e1>  ( <e2> M </e2> ) gene sequences; another, M and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) gene sequences.

True	Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that two  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1>  of low molecular weight with different functional activity,  <e2> ADF </e2>  and cofilin, are transported into nuclei of cultured myogenic cells to form rod structures there together with actin, when the cells were incubated in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide.
False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other:  <e1> profilin </e1>  has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of  <e2> platelet actin </e2>  much more strongly than muscle actin; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of actin with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
False	METHODS: We have performed a detailed study of the pattern of expression of  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  ( <e2> MHC </e2> ), myosin light chain (MLC), troponin I (TnI) isoforms, connexin 43 (Cx43), desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), in the ventricular conduction system of normal and congenitally malformed mouse hearts (iv background) from embryonic day 14.5 to 19.5.
False	Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD14 was identified in a two-hybrid screen using MSH2 as "bait," and pairwise interactions between MSH2 and RAD1,  <e1> RAD2 </e1> , RAD3,  <e2> RAD10 </e2> , RAD14, and RAD25 subsequently were demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis.
False	We constructed recombinant viruses based on the herpes simplex virus type 1 mutant tsK which individually were able to express the products of four viral DNA replication genes ( <e1> UL5 </e1> , UL8, UL9 and  <e2> UL52 </e2> ) in the absence of any of the other proteins required for viral DNA synthesis.
False	Immunohistochemistry for a variety of cytokeratins (CKs) (8/18, 1/10, 7, and 20),  <e1> epithelial membrane antigen </e1>  (EMA), S-100 protein,  <e2> vimentin </e2>  CD34, type IV collagen, smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and glial fibrillary acid protein was performed.
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase,  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2,  <e1> TPM1 </e1> , SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and  <e2> DFG16 </e2> , mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and PIP  <e1> kinases </e1>  and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  and profilin.
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated;  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of  <e2> histone </e2>  H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	 <e1> PDGF </e1>  treatment had no effect on talin, vimentin, or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor ( <e2> EGF </e2> ), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on vinculin or actin distribution.
False	Inhibition of actin polymerization in KCl was stronger than that of the parental  <e1> profilin </e1> , and the Kd value of its interaction with rabbit skeletal muscle actin, as determined by falling ball viscometry, was smaller (mean value 0.5 x 10(-6) M, as compared to 1.9 x 10(-6) M for bovine  <e2> profilin </e2> ).
