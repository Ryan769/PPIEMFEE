True	The  <e1> APC </e1>  binding site on  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  may be discontinuous since neither the carboxyl- nor amino-terminal halves of beta-catenin will independently associate with APC, although the amino-terminal half independently binds alpha-catenin.
False	In this study the role of MSH2,  <e1> MSH3 </e1> , and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the  <e2> MSH2 </e2>  protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins.

False	Several lines of evidence show that the profilins fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human  <e1> profilins </e1>  rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified  <e2> profilin </e2>  without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba profilin-I has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

False	These results suggest that TNF-alpha can cause apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells through TNFR1-linked apoptotic factors, TRADD,  <e1> FADD </e1> , and  <e2> FLICE </e2> , and TNF-induced ceramide production may be involved in the pathways.

True	We conclude that Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts  <e1> cofilin </e1>  localization to cortical  <e2> actin </e2>  patches.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the  <e1> Pkc1p </e1>  pathway such as ROM2, RHO2,  <e2> HCS77 </e2> /WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.

False	Although platelets contain only 1 profilin for every 5-10  <e1> actin </e1>  molecules, these complex reactions may allow substoichiometric  <e2> profilin </e2>  to have an important influence on actin assembly.
False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD,  <e1> DR3 </e1> ,  <e2> FAF </e2> , TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

False	Using the 'nuclear displacement assay' as a measure of the integrity of the  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton in living stamen hair cells, we demonstrated that AtFim1 protects actin filaments in these cells from Z. mays profilin ( <e2> ZmPRO5 </e2> )-induced depolymerization, in a dose-dependent manner.
False	Because other researchers have shown that the RAD51 and RAD52 proteins interact, RAD51 on a high copy number plasmid was tested and found to suppress the rad52-20 allele, but RAD 54,  <e1> 55 </e1>  and  <e2> 57 </e2>  did not suppress.
True	The tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 ( <e1> TNFR1 </e1> ) and the Fas receptor recruit complexes formed by the interactions between RIP kinase,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , FADD and RAIDD - adaptor proteins that contain death domains - which in turn recruit other proteins to initiate signaling [1][2][3][4][5].
True	In addition, we also provide new evidence to suggest that HRG stimulation of the  <e1> EF-1alpha </e1>  promoter involves increased physical interactions with acetylated histone H3 and histone  <e2> H4 </e2> .
False	However, immunofluorescence staining revealed a similar organisation of  <e1> actin </e1>  microfilaments,  <e2> talin </e2>  and phosphotyrosyl-containing proteins on both substrates.

False	To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the  <e1> actin </e1>  dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments.
False	ADP-ribosylation of  <e1> actin </e1>  at Arg 177 by Clostridium perfringens iota toxin increased the nucleotide dissociation rate from 2.2 x 10(-3) s-1 to 4.5 x 10(-3) s-1 without affecting the  <e2> profilin </e2> -induced stimulation of nucleotide exchange.
True	Because histone  <e1> H3 </e1>  shares many structural features with histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  and is intimately associated with H4 in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether H3 has similar functions.
False	The C-terminal of TRADD comprises the "death domain" that is responsible for association of TNFR1 and other death domain-containing proteins such as  <e1> FADD </e1>  and  <e2> RIP </e2> .
False	For example, it is associated with alpha-catenin and  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  ( <e2> Armadillo </e2> ), and protected from trypsin digestion only in the presence of Ca2+, as is the case for many of classic cadherins.
True	Protein phosphorylation of  <e1> cofilin </e1> , an  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2>  that depolymerizes actin filaments, suppresses its function.
False	PDGF treatment had no effect on talin, vimentin, or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 30 ng/ml  <e1> somatomedin C </e1> , or 10 microM insulin also had no effect on  <e2> vinculin </e2>  or actin distribution.

False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that  <e1> histone </e1>  H4, and not histone  <e2> H3 </e2> , was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of N-cadherin,  <e1> APC </e1> , and Tcf-4, which bind to the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.
True	Although profilin released actin at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of  <e1> actin </e1>  released from  <e2> profilin </e2>  too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
True	PF4-dependent downregulation of cyclin E-cdk2 activity was associated with increased binding of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21( <e1> Cip1 </e1> /WAF1), to the  <e2> cyclin E </e2> -cdk2 complex.
True	Together these results indicate that  <e1> TGFbeta </e1>  regulates clusterin gene expression through an AP-1 site and its cognate transcription factor AP-1, and requires the involvement of  <e2> protein kinase C </e2> .

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of  <e1> MKK1 </e1>  (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/ <e2> SLG1 </e2>  and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
True	The involvement of the death adaptor proteins FADD/MORT1, TRADD, and RIP and the apoptosis-initiating caspases-8 and  <e1> -10 </e1>  in death signaling by the two death-inducing TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and  <e2> TRAIL-R2 </e2> ) are controversial.
True	The results indicate that (a) plakoglobin and beta-catenin differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with LEF-1 and vinculin; (b) LEF-1-dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by beta-catenin; and (c) the cytoplasmic partners of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> ,  <e2> cadherin </e2>  and alpha-catenin, can sequester it to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity.

True	This activity is independent of FADD-DN's ability to bind to three known interacting proteins, Fas, TRADD or RIP suggesting that it is distinct from  <e1> FADD </e1> 's functions at activated  <e2> death receptors </e2> .
False	This approach is based on the assumption that an  <e1> actin </e1>  mutation that specifically impairs the interaction with an actin-binding protein will cause a phenotype similar to a null mutation in the gene that encodes the  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2> .
False	Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of beta-catenin with  <e1> EGFR </e1>  were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of alpha-catenin from  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  was not.

False	One, MORT1 (also called FADD), binds to  <e1> Fas </e1> /APO1 but not to p55-R; another,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to Fas/APO1; and the third, RIP, binds weakly to both receptors.

False	Reduced  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin, beta-catenin and  <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  expression correlated closely with the differentiation grade of the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (p < 0.05).
True	Birch  <e1> pollen profilin </e1>  and  <e2> actin </e2>  can be copurified as a complex, and purified recombinant birch profilin can be used as an affinity matrix to obtain birch pollen actin.
True	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone  <e1> H3 </e1> , whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous  <e2> acetylase(s) </e2> .
False	In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and  <e1> msh6 </e1>  mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the  <e2> MSH2 </e2>  protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins.
False	From these observations it is concluded that (i) RAD52 is required for high levels of both gene conversions and reciprocal crossovers, (ii) that RAD51 is not required for intrachromosomal crossovers, and (iii) that RAD51 and  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  have different functions, or that  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  has functions in addition to those of the Rad51/Rad52 protein complex.
False	Immunohistochemical studies showed a strong reactivity of most LAM cells for alpha-smooth muscle actin and  <e1> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain </e1>  and a weak to moderate reactivity of a lesser number of cells for  <e2> desmin </e2>  and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-B.
False	Archaeal histones are most similar to the globular histone fold region of eukaryal  <e1> histone </e1>  H4, and the results reported are consistent with archaeal nucleosomes resembling the structure formed by eukaryal  <e2> histone </e2>  (H3+H4)2tetramers.
False	Linkage between cancer susceptibility and the candidate DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2,  <e1> MSH3 </e1> , and MSH6 ( <e2> GTBP </e2> ) was investigated.
False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of histone  <e1> H3 </e1> : with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was  <e2> histone </e2>  H3, whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).

False	 <e1> rad59 </e1>  mutations completely abolished the ability to generate type II survivors, while  <e2> rad50 </e2>  mutations decreased the growth viability of type II survivors but did not completely eliminate their appearance.
False	The potentiating effect of insulin appears to involve increases in the expression of  <e1> cyclin E </e1>  and decreases in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27( <e2> Kip1 </e2> ).

False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where  <e1> N </e1>  is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene;  <e2> G </e2>  is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.
False	Analyses of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  or  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  immunoprecipitates from BMMC lysate revealed that alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin were co-precipitated, suggesting that E-cadherin and catenins form a complex in mast cells.
False	From these we have isolated eight viable and lethal alleles of the  <e1> muscle myosin heavy chain </e1>  gene, and seven viable alleles of the indirect flight muscle (IFM)-specific Act88F  <e2> actin </e2>  gene.
False	Seventeen embryonic genes were identified as embryonic alpha-tubulin,  <e1> embryonic beta-tubulin </e1> , hnRNP, protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT), ferritin heavy chain, type IV collagen,  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2>  cofilin, profilin and nine novel sequences designated as A1-9.

False	In contrast, EC located immediately behind the migrating front retained junctional VE-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , and beta-catenin while  <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  was absent from these sites.
False	In the basal layer, patches of brightly labeled cells were detected with antibodies to  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, but not with antibodies to P-cadherin,  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , or with pan-desmocollin and pan-desmoglein antibodies.
True	Deletion of  <e1> SIR4 </e1>  enhanced mURA3 and  <e2> MET15 </e2>  silencing, but deletion of SIR1 or SIR3 did not affect silencing, indicating that the mechanism of silencing differs from that at telomeres and silent mating loci.
False	The predicted sequence of AtFim1 shares ca. 40% identity with nonplant fimbrins and contains two tandem repeats, each possessing a 27 amino acid region identified as a putative actin-binding domain in  <e1> fimbrins </e1>  and in a larger family of  <e2> actin </e2>  cross-linking proteins.

False	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of  <e1> dystrophin </e1> , utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo  <e2> 87K </e2>  protein.
False	The proximity of the semi-conserved  <e1> actin </e1> -binding site and the binding pocket characteristic of plant profilins suggests that epitopes encompassing both features are responsible for the cross-reactivity of antibodies between human and plant  <e2> profilins </e2>  thought to be responsible for type I allergies.
False	The NH2-terminal 16kD of Abp1p, a 65-kD yeast protein identified by its ability to bind to  <e1> actin </e1>  filaments, is 23% identical to yeast  <e2> cofilin </e2> .
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of  <e1> PLC-delta </e1> , which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to  <e2> actin binding proteins </e2>  such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	Stable transfection of mutant plakoglobin molecules showed that deletion of the  <e1> N-cadherin </e1>  binding domain, but not the alpha-catenin binding domain, abolished  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  downregulation.
False	Purification of a cortical complex containing two unconventional  <e1> actins </e1>  from Acanthamoeba by affinity chromatography on  <e2> profilin </e2> -agarose.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 ( <e1> MAP kinase </e1> ) mimicked  <e2> PKC1 </e2>  as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	Compared with control and contralateral kidneys, the ligated kidneys displayed a dynamic expression of mRNAs for many apoptosis-related molecules, which included an up to threefold increase for  <e1> Fas </e1> , Fas ligand, TNF-R1, TRAIL,  <e2> TRADD </e2> , RIP, and caspase-8, and an up to twofold increase for FADD and FAP, but there was little change for FAF.
False	 <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , but not E-cadherin, p120(cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when  <e2> proteasome </e2> -mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.
True	The in vivo and in vitro properties of yeast  <e1> profilin </e1>  mutants with altered poly-L-proline and  <e2> actin </e2>  binding sites are discussed in the context of the crystal structure.

False	The main inhibitory action of p27, a  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  (CDKI), arises from its binding with the  <e2> cyclin E </e2> /cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex that results in G(1)-S arrest.
False	After 24 or 48 hours of shear, staining for  <e1> VE-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin, and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  was intense and peripheral, forming a band of "dashes" (adherens plaques) that colocalized with the ends of stress fibers that inserted along the lateral membranes of cells.
False	In these investigations, we determine that recruitment of a coactivator protein, CBP (the  <e1> CREBbinding protein </e1> ), to the CYBB or NCF2 promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by  <e2> PU.1 </e2> , IRF1, and ICSBP.
True	Removal of the amino-terminal tails of either histone H3 or  <e1> histone </e1>   <e2> H4 </e2>  allowed these polyamides to bind.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <e1> IL-2 </e1>  production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via  <e2> p38 </e2>  MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
True	One,  <e1> MORT1 </e1>  (also called FADD), binds to Fas/ <e2> APO1 </e2>  but not to p55-R; another, TRADD, binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to Fas/APO1; and the third, RIP, binds weakly to both receptors.
False	Results from epistasis analyses indicate that MSH2 functions in mismatch repair in conjunction with MSH3 or  <e1> MSH6 </e1>  and that MSH3 and  <e2> MSH6 </e2>  constitute alternate pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair.
False	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of p27 with  <e1> cyclin E </e1> /CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to  <e2> cyclin E </e2> /CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).
False	 <e1> RAD51 </e1> ,  <e2> RAD52 </e2> , RAD57, and RAD59 were required for efficient gap repair using either chromosomal or plasmid donors.
False	Here we use physical monitoring of DNA to show that MAT switching is completely blocked at an early step in recombination in strains deleted for the DNA repair genes  <e1> RAD51 </e1> , RAD52,  <e2> RAD54 </e2> , RAD55 or RAD57.
False	Electrical stimulation of cardiocyte contraction did not enhance alpha-cardiac actin or myosin heavy chain (alpha+ <e1> beta </e1> ) mRNA transcript levels relative to  <e2> 28S rRNA </e2>  during the period of rapid growth that occurred over the first 48 hours.
True	Further, we show that talin, a high molecular weight structural protein that links  <e1> integrins </e1>  to the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton, is proteolytically cleaved in fetal, but not in neonatal melanocytes.
False	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase ( <e1> TS </e1> ),  <e2> dihydrofolate reductase </e2>  (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase (PNR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), histone H1, histone H2A + 2B, histone H3, and histone H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.

False	The verprolin-like central (vc) region of  <e1> Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein </e1>  induces Arp2/ <e2> 3 </e2>  complex-dependent actin nucleation.
True	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of ActA binds one actin monomer, in a profilin-like fashion, and  <e1> Arp2 </e1> / <e2> 3 </e2>  complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of WASp family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by Arp2/3 complex.
True	Together these results indicate that  <e1> TGFbeta </e1>  regulates  <e2> clusterin </e2>  gene expression through an AP-1 site and its cognate transcription factor AP-1, and requires the involvement of protein kinase C.
True	While poly(ADP-ribose) effectively competed with DNA for binding of histone H4, it equally competed with DNA for binding of histone H3 and only inefficiently competed with DNA for binding of  <e1> histone </e1>   <e2> H1 </e2> .
False	This activity is independent of  <e1> FADD-DN </e1> 's ability to bind to three known interacting proteins, Fas, TRADD or RIP suggesting that it is distinct from FADD's functions at activated  <e2> death receptors </e2> .
False	An association was seen between E-cadherin and  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  expression, in both effusions and solid tumours, and for  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  in solid tumours (range p<0. 001 to p=0.014).
True	The very much lower affinity of  <e1> profilin </e1>  for modified  <e2> actin </e2>  explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by profilin of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone  <e1> H3 </e1> , was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/ <e2> p300 </e2> , and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and PIP  <e1> kinases </e1>  and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
True	 <e1> TNF receptor </e1>  death domain-associated proteins TRADD and  <e2> FADD </e2>  signal activation of acid sphingomyelinase.

False	There are three histone H3 genes, two of which are identical; four histone H2a genes, two of which are identical, one  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 gene; and two  <e2> histone </e2>  H2b genes.
False	Molecular analysis of the  <e1> cadherin </e1> -catenin complex elucidated the central role of beta-catenin in this adhesion complex, as it binds to the cytoplasmic domain of  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  and to alpha-catenin.
True	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and  <e1> alpha 1-syntrophin </e1>  interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin,  <e2> utrophin </e2> /dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.
False	Inactivation of the Rb pathway in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) occurs mostly through inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p16 </e1> (INK4A) and/or up-regulation of  <e2> cyclin D1 </e2> .
False	Consistent with the observation that beta-catenin and  <e1> plakoglobin </e1>  bind to the same region of alpha-catenin,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  competed with the binding of plakoglobin to alpha-catenin and vice versa.
False	The sites on the  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  that interact with actin and are responsible for force generation are ill-defined: crosslinking and experiments with isolated domains of the myosin head implicate regions in both the 50K and 20K (molecular weights in thousands) domains of the  <e2> myosin </e2>  head (subfragment 1, S1) in this process.
True	Interaction of  <e1> Munc-18-2 </e1>  with  <e2> syntaxin 3 </e2>  controls the association of apical SNAREs in epithelial cells.

False	Both types of beads induced the recruitment of  <e1> N-cadherin </e1> ,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , alpha-catenin and p120, by lateral mobilization of preexisting cell membrane complexes.
True	Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like  <e1> beta 1-syntrophin </e1> , both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/ <e2> dystrophin related protein </e2> , and the Torpedo 87K protein.
False	Under all conditions, platelets retained 40-50% of their total actin and greater than 70% of their actin-binding protein ( <e1> ABP </e1> ) but lost greater than 80% of  <e2> talin </e2>  and myosin to the supernatant.
False	Transfection of plasmids encoding the BRSV minigenome,  <e1> nucleocapsid protein </e1>  ( <e2> N </e2> ), phosphoprotein (P) and L protein, each under the control of T7 promoter, into cells infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the T7 RNA polymerase gave rise to CAT activity and progeny with the minigenome.
False	However, some proteins (e.g., profilin) and other agents (e.g., cytochalasin D) that bind to  <e1> actin </e1>  are affected by the presence of fluorescent labels, making  <e2> actin </e2>  intrinsic fluorescence potentially useful in investigating the interaction of these agents with actin, and in validating data obtained using labeled actin.
False	PDGF treatment had no effect on talin,  <e1> vimentin </e1> , or microtubule distribution in BALB/c-3T3 cells; in addition, exposure of cells to 5% platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 0.1% PPP, 30 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 30 ng/ml somatomedin C, or 10 microM  <e2> insulin </e2>  also had no effect on vinculin or actin distribution.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39,  <e1> STE12 </e1> , TEC1,  <e2> WHI3 </e2> , NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	A null mutation of the actin gene ( <e1> ACT1 </e1> ) is lethal, but null mutations in the tropomyosin (TPM1), fimbrin (SAC6), Abp1p (ABP1), and capping protein (CAP1 and  <e2> CAP2 </e2> ) genes have relatively mild or no effects.
False	In contrast,  <e1> act1-159 </e1>  partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in fimbrin, Mdm20p, and tropomyosin null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these  <e2> actin </e2> -binding proteins.
False	Immunohistochemistry revealed that arteries had three distinct populations of cells in respect to alpha-smooth muscle actin,  <e1> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain </e1>  and  <e2> vimentin </e2>  (staining intensities '-', '+' or '++' for each protein), but only two populations in respect to desmin ('-' and '+').
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated;  <e1> histone </e1>  H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone  <e2> H3 </e2> ; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
True	These results suggest that the dysfunction of E-cadherin in these cell lines is due primarily to its failure to interact with  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , and that this defect results from the mutation in  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .
True	The C374S mutation had the most pronounced effect; it reduced the polymerizability of the  <e1> actin </e1> , abolished its binding to  <e2> profilin </e2> , and filaments containing this mutation moved at reduced rates in the in vitro 'motility assay'.
False	To characterize the AAV functions mediating this effect, cloned AAV type 2 wild-type or mutant genomes were transfected into simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed hamster cells together with the six HSV replication genes (encoding UL5, UL8,  <e1> major DNA-binding protein </e1> , DNA polymerase,  <e2> UL42 </e2> , and UL52) which together are necessary and sufficient for the induction of SV40 DNA amplification (R. Heilbronn and H. zur Hausen, J. Virol. 63:3683-3692, 1989).
True	In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the domains on  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  that allow it to associate with beta-catenin/ <e2> plakoglobin </e2>  and with alpha-actinin.
False	Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD14 was identified in a two-hybrid screen using MSH2 as "bait," and pairwise interactions between MSH2 and  <e1> RAD1 </e1> , RAD2,  <e2> RAD3 </e2> , RAD10, RAD14, and RAD25 subsequently were demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis.
False	The sizes and characteristics of each of the proteins determined from various radiolabelling experiments allowed preliminary identification of the proteins as the large ( <e1> L </e1> ; 190 kDa), haemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN; 74 kDa), nucleocapsid (N; 66 kDa), fusion (F0; 63 kDa), phosphoprotein (P; 49 kDa), matrix (M; 43 kDa) and non-structural (V; 35 kDa)  <e2> proteins </e2> .
False	The 16236 nt genome encodes eight proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), V protein, matrix protein (M), fusion protein ( <e1> F </e1> ), small hydrophobic ( <e2> SH </e2> ) protein, haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein and large (L) protein, which are flanked by a 55 nt leader sequence and a 54 nt trailer sequence.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1,  <e1> SPA2 </e1> , BNI1, DFG5, DFG9, DFG10,  <e2> BUD8 </e2>  and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	To clarify the relation between alteration of expression of cell adhesion molecules and progression of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas 55 cases were immunohistochemically examined for E-cadherin, alpha-catenin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , and CD44, with additional reverse transcription- <e2> polymerase </e2>  chain reaction and Southern blotting hybridization (RT-PCR/SBH) assays.
False	Fusiform RPE, however, were not deficient in these proteins, expressing amounts of N-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , beta-catenin, plakoglobin, p120,  <e2> alpha-actinin </e2>  and vinculin that were equivalent to epithelioid cells.
False	Biopsies taken prior to NAC and operative specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for alpha-catenin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> ,  <e2> E-cadherin </e2> , and CD44 isoform 6 (CD44v6), to uncover the role of adhesion molecules as determinants of the response to NAC and disease outcome.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor  <e1> AP-1 </e1>  and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase ( <e2> MAPK </e2> )/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
False	The gene for the human  <e1> CREB binding protein </e1> , the transcriptional coactivator  <e2> CBP </e2> , is included in the RT1 cosmid, and mutations in CBP have recently been identified in nondeleted RTS patients.

True	In contrast, act1-159 partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a  <e1> tropomyosin </e1>  mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in fimbrin, Mdm20p, and tropomyosin null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these  <e2> actin </e2> -binding proteins.
False	Hypertonicity provoked Fyn-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in beta-catenin, alpha-catenin, and p120( <e1> Cas </e1> ) and caused the dissociation of  <e2> beta-catenin </e2>  from the contacts.
False	Finally, we evaluated the acetylation of three putative  <e1> PCAF </e1>  substrates, histones H3 and H4 and the transcription factor p53, and have determined that  <e2> histone </e2>  H3 is significantly preferred over the histone H4 and p53 substrates.

False	Our findings strongly suggest that in brain  <e1> profilin I </e1>  and  <e2> profilin II </e2>  complexes link the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic membrane flow, directing actin and clathrin assembly to distinct membrane domains.
False	The core histones from Physarum,  <e1> histones </e1>  H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian  <e2> histone </e2>  H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	The involvement of the death adaptor proteins  <e1> FADD </e1> / <e2> MORT1 </e2> , TRADD, and RIP and the apoptosis-initiating caspases-8 and -10 in death signaling by the two death-inducing TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) are controversial.
False	Lethality of the srs2Delta rad54Delta and srs2Delta  <e1> rdh54Delta </e1>  double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2  <e2> rad54 </e2>  and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant  <e1> BCK1-20 </e1>  mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed  <e2> glc7-10 </e2>  effectively.

False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  <e1> RFC5 </e1> , DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3,  <e2> RAD53 </e2> , CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.
False	Experiments using a peptide that corresponds to the N-terminus of thymosin beta(4) (residues 6-22) confirm the presence of an extensive binding surface between  <e1> actin </e1>  and thymosin beta(4), and explain why thymosin beta(4) and  <e2> profilin </e2>  can bind simultaneously to actin.

False	Using ITP (a substrate for  <e1> myosin II </e1>  ATPase) and/or ATP gamma S (a substrate for myosin II heavy-chain kinase [MHCK]), we demonstrated that phosphorylation of myosin heavy chains occurred at the foci within the  <e2> actin </e2>  network, a result that suggests that MHCK was localized at the foci.
False	Molecular analysis of the cadherin- <e1> catenin </e1>  complex elucidated the central role of beta-catenin in this adhesion complex, as it binds to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin and to  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> .
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2  <e1> MEC3 </e1> , RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24,  <e2> BUB3 </e2> , and MAD3 had little effect.

False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of  <e1> FLICE </e1> ,  <e2> Fas </e2> , FADD, DR3, FAF, TRADD, and RIP was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.

False	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of ActA binds one actin monomer, in a profilin-like fashion, and  <e1> Arp2 </e1> /3 complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of WASp family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by  <e2> Arp2 </e2> /3 complex.
False	These data strongly suggest that the head, neck, and tail domains of all myosin heavy chains, and light chains at least of class II myosins, have coevolved and are likely to be functionally interdependent, consistent with biochemical evidence showing that regulated  <e1> actin </e1> -dependent  <e2> MgATPase </e2>  activity of Dictyostelium myosin II requires isoform specific interactions between the heavy chain head and tail and light chains.
False	To characterize the AAV functions mediating this effect, cloned AAV type 2 wild-type or mutant genomes were transfected into simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed hamster cells together with the six HSV replication genes (encoding UL5, UL8,  <e1> major DNA-binding protein </e1> , DNA polymerase, UL42, and  <e2> UL52 </e2> ) which together are necessary and sufficient for the induction of SV40 DNA amplification (R. Heilbronn and H. zur Hausen, J. Virol. 63:3683-3692, 1989).

False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas,  <e1> FADD </e1> , DR3, FAF, TRADD, and  <e2> RIP </e2>  was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
True	Cotransfections with different combinations of these genes demonstrated that a subset of four of them, coding for the HSV helicase-primase complex ( <e1> UL5 </e1> , UL8,  <e2> UL52 </e2> ) and the major DNA-binding protein (UL29), was already sufficient to mediate the helper effect.

False	This arrest can be suppressed by mutations in  <e1> RAD51 </e1> , RAD52, and  <e2> RAD57 </e2> , suggesting that the cell cycle defect in sgs1 srs2 mutants results from inappropriate homologous recombination.
False	Treatment with HNE resulted in activation of  <e1> extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases </e1>  ERK1 and ERK2, induction of c-fos and c-jun protein expression, and an increase in transcription factor  <e2> AP-1 </e2>  DNA binding activity.
True	For example, it is associated with alpha-catenin and  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  (Armadillo), and protected from trypsin digestion only in the presence of Ca2+, as is the case for many of classic  <e2> cadherins </e2> .

False	These results indicate that the assembly of cytoskeletal and  <e1> sarcomeric a <e2> ctins </e1>  </e2>  is regulated differently by profilin in the developing skeletal muscle, and that the former may not be involved in myofibril assembly.
False	The neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, Factor-XIIIa, alpha-smooth muscle actin and CD34, but negative for desmin, calponin, high molecular weight caldesmon, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, collagen type IV,  <e1> laminin </e1>  and  <e2> S-100 </e2>  protein.

True	Silencing mediated by  <e1> GBD </e1> - <e2> SIR1 </e2>  requires the trans-acting factors that normally participate in repression, namely, SIR2, SIR3, SIR4, and histone H4.
False	Analysis of V3, a hamster equivalent of SCID, indicates that the protein level increases of  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  and  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  from G0 to G1/S/G2 do not require DNA-PK.
False	Once the  <e1> actin </e1>  monomer is bound to the filament, the  <e2> profilin </e2>  is released, and is available to bind to additional actin monomers.
False	The sizes and characteristics of each of the proteins determined from various radiolabelling experiments allowed preliminary identification of the proteins as the large (L; 190 kDa), haemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN; 74 kDa), nucleocapsid (N; 66 kDa), fusion (F0; 63 kDa), phosphoprotein ( <e1> P </e1> ; 49 kDa), matrix (M; 43 kDa) and non-structural (V; 35 kDa)  <e2> proteins </e2> .

True	These findings suggest that this novel  <e1> RhoGAP </e1>  is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of  <e2> PLC-delta </e2> , which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via  <e1> mitogen-activated protein kinase </e1>  (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and  <e2> c-Jun N-terminal kinase </e2> , but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
False	The results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is achieved by  <e1> EGFR </e1>  upon tryptic digestion of cells and concurrent with but independent of dissociation of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  from E-cadherin.
False	Several lines of evidence show that the  <e1> profilins </e1>  fully renature after removal of the urea by dialysis: 1) dialyzed Acanthamoeba and human profilins rebind quantitatively to poly-L-proline and bind to actin in the same way as native, conventionally purified profilin without urea treatment; 2) dialyzed profilins form 3-D crystals under the same conditions as native profilins; 3) dialyzed Acanthamoeba  <e2> profilin-I </e2>  has an NMR spectrum identical with that of native profilin-I; and 4) dialyzed human and Acanthamoeba profilins inhibit actin polymerization.

True	 <e1> Neuropilin-1 </e1>  is also expressed in endothelial cells and shown to bind  <e2> vascular endothelial growth factor </e2>  (VEGF), a potent regulator for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.
False	In their cytoplasmic region, some of these receptors share a conserved sequence motif - the 'death domain' - which is required for transduction of the apoptotic signal by recruiting other death-domain-containing adaptor molecules like the Fas-associated protein  <e1> FADD </e1> /MORT1 or the TNF receptor-associated protein  <e2> TRADD </e2>  [2-4].

True	These data suggest that nuclear  <e1> profilin </e1>  can mediate a stimulus-response action on the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton which is somehow linked to a phosphoinositide-signaling cascade.
True	CONCLUSION: The results show that  <e1> Munc-18-2 </e1>  and  <e2> syntaxin 3 </e2>  form a complex in vivo and suggest that they participate in epithelial cell differentiation and targeted vesicle transport processes in the developing kidney.

False	Using the known three-dimensional structure of the homologous actin-binding domain of  <e1> fimbrin </e1> , these results have enabled us to determine the likely orientation of the utrophin actin-binding domain with respect to the  <e2> actin </e2>  filament.
False	Specific antibodies to myosin heavy chain isoforms (SM1, SM2, SMemb),  <e1> caldesmon </e1> , and alpha-smooth muscle actin and cDNAs for  <e2> SMemb </e2>  were used.
False	The core, isolated in the absence of free Ca2+, contains five major proteins: the  <e1> actin </e1>  (Mr 43 000) that makes up the filaments, the villin (Mr 95 000) and fimbrin (Mr 68 000) that cross-link the filaments together, and the 110 000 Mr polypeptide- <e2> calmodulin </e2>  complex that makes up cross-filaments which project laterally from the core and link it to the inner surface of the microvillus membrane.
False	Identification of alpha-syntrophin binding to  <e1> syntrophin triplet </e1> , dystrophin, and  <e2> utrophin </e2> .
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone  <e1> H4 </e1> , and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/ <e2> waf1 </e2>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	Deletion of  <e1> SIR4 </e1>  enhanced mURA3 and MET15 silencing, but deletion of SIR1 or  <e2> SIR3 </e2>  did not affect silencing, indicating that the mechanism of silencing differs from that at telomeres and silent mating loci.

False	The proximity of the semi-conserved  <e1> actin </e1> -binding site and the binding pocket characteristic of plant  <e2> profilins </e2>  suggests that epitopes encompassing both features are responsible for the cross-reactivity of antibodies between human and plant profilins thought to be responsible for type I allergies.
False	The undifferentiated cells (a) were unable to spread on gelatin or laminin and grew as rounded colonies, although they were able to spread on fibronectin (b) showed reduced adhesion to laminin, but not  <e1> fibronectin </e1>  (c) expressed much reduced levels of beta1 integrin, although levels of alpha5 and alphaV were wild-type (d) were less polarized with increased membrane protrusions compared with a  <e2> vinculin </e2>  (-/-) ES cell mutant (e) were unable to assemble vinculin or paxillin-containing focal adhesions or actin stress fibers on fibronectin, whereas vinculin (-/-) ES cells were able to assemble talin-containing focal adhesions.

False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant  <e1> BCK1-20 </e1>  mutation nor increased dosage of  <e2> MKK1 </e2>  (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.

True	In this study, we demonstrate that  <e1> profilin </e1>  isoforms expressed in a single cell can have different effects on  <e2> actin </e2>  in living cells and that the poly-L-proline binding function of profilin may have important consequences for the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in plant cells.

False	The RAD51-interacting region (amino acids 291-330) of the human RAD52 protein shows no homology with the yeast  <e1> RAD52 </e1>  protein, indicating that the interaction between RAD51 and  <e2> RAD52 </e2>  is species-specific.

False	Results from epistasis analyses indicate that MSH2 functions in mismatch repair in conjunction with  <e1> MSH3 </e1>  or  <e2> MSH6 </e2>  and that MSH3 and MSH6 constitute alternate pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair.
False	These  <e1> histone </e1>  H3 and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and H2a mRNA, whereas the histone H4 and histone H2b genes encode < 10% of the total  <e2> H4 </e2>  and H2b mRNA.

True	However, in non-adherent cells no molecular mechanism has yet been proposed for the cell adhesion-dependent up-regulation of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), and the associated inhibition of  <e1> cyclin E </e1> - <e2> CDK2 </e2> .
False	The centrifugation assay and the DNase I inhibition assay demonstrate that  <e1> cofilin </e1>  binds to actin filaments in a 1:1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament and that cofilin increases the monomeric  <e2> actin </e2>  to a limited extent (up to 1.1-1.5 microM monomer) in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl.

False	Immunohistochemistry for a variety of cytokeratins (CKs) (8/18, 1/10, 7, and 20), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein,  <e1> vimentin </e1>  CD34,  <e2> type IV collagen </e2> , smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and glial fibrillary acid protein was performed.
False	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <e1> p27 </e1> , enhanced association of p27 with  <e2> cyclin E </e2> /CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).

False	To investigate the role of  <e1> cofilin </e1>  in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the actin dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments.
False	 <e1> Glutathione S-transferase </e1>  pull-down performed with Tax deletion mutants and peptide competition have localized the site in Tax critical for binding CBP/ <e2> p300 </e2>  to a highly protease-sensitive region around amino acid residues 81 to 95 (81QRTSKTLKVLTPPIT95) which lies between the domains previously proposed to be important for CREB binding and Tax subunit dimerization.

False	Results from epistasis analyses indicate that MSH2 functions in mismatch repair in conjunction with MSH3 or  <e1> MSH6 </e1>  and that  <e2> MSH3 </e2>  and MSH6 constitute alternate pathways of MSH2-dependent mismatch repair.
False	One, MORT1 (also called  <e1> FADD </e1> ), binds to Fas/APO1 but not to p55-R; another, TRADD, binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to Fas/APO1; and the third,  <e2> RIP </e2> , binds weakly to both receptors.
False	Immunoprecipitation with an E-cadherin mAb, which is known to co-precipitate the catenins, demonstrated that the three poorly differentiated cell lines expressing E-cadherin did not co-precipitate  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , although all of the moderately-well differentiated cell lines expressed both alpha- and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .
False	We have examined the level of  <e1> cyclin E </e1> , a G1 cyclin, and p27kip, a  <e2> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e2> , in BALB/c 3T3 cells.
False	These proteins each have a verprolin-homology (V) domain,  <e1> cofilin </e1> -homology (C) domain and an acidic (A) region at the C-terminus, through which they activate the Arp2/3 complex, leading to rapid  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization.
False	However, in non-adherent cells no molecular mechanism has yet been proposed for the cell adhesion-dependent up-regulation of the p27  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  (CKI), and the associated inhibition of cyclin E- <e2> CDK2 </e2> .
False	When liver- or  <e1> islet-type glucokinase </e1>  was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, the expressed  <e2> glucokinase </e2>  was also co-localized with actin filaments in the cytoplasm of these transfected cells.
False	Both tyrosine phosphorylation and association of  <e1> beta-catenin </e1>  with EGFR were inhibited by tyrphostin, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas dissociation of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  from E-cadherin was not.
True	In infected cells, C protein was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm as granular fluorescence, which coincided very well with the distribution of  <e1> nucleocapsid protein </e1>   <e2> NP </e2>  and phosphoprotein P, which were also detected with specific antisera.
False	The sites on the myosin heavy chain that interact with  <e1> actin </e1>  and are responsible for force generation are ill-defined: crosslinking and experiments with isolated domains of the  <e2> myosin </e2>  head implicate regions in both the 50K and 20K (molecular weights in thousands) domains of the myosin head (subfragment 1, S1) in this process.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9,  <e1> RAD17 </e1> , RAD24,  <e2> BUB3 </e2> , and MAD3 had little effect.

True	This suggests that dephosphorylation of cofilin and  <e1> destrin </e1> /ADF by  <e2> TSH </e2>  could be implicated in the disruption of actin-containing stress fibers and in the reorganization of microfilaments induced by this hormone.
True	Using these methods, we confirm previous reports that intact  <e1> talin </e1>  induces cross-linking as well as filament shortening on  <e2> actin </e2>  networks.
False	This arrest can be suppressed by mutations in RAD51, RAD52, and  <e1> RAD57 </e1> , suggesting that the cell cycle defect in  <e2> sgs1 </e2>  srs2 mutants results from inappropriate homologous recombination.
False	We have examined the level of cyclin E, a  <e1> G1 cyclin </e1> , and  <e2> p27kip </e2> , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in BALB/c 3T3 cells.

False	To investigate the role of  <e1> cofilin </e1>  in EGF-stimulated actin polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the  <e2> actin </e2>  dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.
True	The  <e1> cofilin </e1>  homology sequence is critical for stimulating actin nucleation with the Arp2/3 complex in vitro, and is essential for  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization and motility in cells.

Kovar et al. (2000) Plant J 24:625-636].
False	The radioresistant N10 and parental KB cell lines were examined for the expression of human DNA repair genes which were related to the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage by northern blot analysis using five kinds of DNA probes ( <e1> XRCC1 </e1> , XRCC3,  <e2> XRCC5 </e2> , RAD51, RAD52).
True	The phosphoprotein (P) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotypes New Jersey [P(NJ)] and Indiana [ <e1> P(I) </e1> ] contains a highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain which is required for binding to the cognate N-RNA template as well as to form a soluble complex with the nucleocapsid protein  <e2> N </e2>  in vivo.
False	Deletion of  <e1> SIR4 </e1>  enhanced mURA3 and MET15 silencing, but deletion of  <e2> SIR1 </e2>  or SIR3 did not affect silencing, indicating that the mechanism of silencing differs from that at telomeres and silent mating loci.
False	Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD14 was identified in a two-hybrid screen using  <e1> MSH2 </e1>  as "bait," and pairwise interactions between MSH2 and RAD1,  <e2> RAD2 </e2> , RAD3, RAD10, RAD14, and RAD25 subsequently were demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis.

False	We used yeast as a model to test this hypothesis and found that chromosome deletion of any known nuclear mitotic mismatch repair genes, including MLH1,  <e1> MSH2 </e1> , MSH3, MSH6, and PMS1, did not rescue mgt1delta O6 MeG DNA repair  <e2> methyltransferase </e2> -deficient cells from killing by MNNG.
False	We found that the expression of all these genes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), ribonucleotide reductase (PNR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),  <e1> histone </e1>  H1, histone H2A + 2B, histone H3, and  <e2> histone </e2>  H4, was induced to high levels in young IMR-90 cells but not in old IMR-90 cells.
False	In investigating the mechanism by which  <e1> pRb </e1>  induces senescence, we have found that pRb causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in  <e2> cyclin E-associated kinase </e2>  activity.
False	The herpes simplex virus type-1 UL5,  <e1> UL8 </e1> , and  <e2> UL52 </e2>  genes encode an essential heterotrimeric DNA helicase-primase that is responsible for concomitant DNA unwinding and primer synthesis at the viral DNA replication fork.
False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1, WHI3, NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2,  <e1> TPM1 </e1> , SPA2, BNI1, DFG5, DFG9,  <e2> DFG10 </e2> , BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of  <e1> N-cadherin </e1> , APC, and Tcf-4, which bind to the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.
False	Acidic domain of the  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  ( <e2> P </e2> ) of vesicular stomatitis virus differentially interacts with homologous and heterologous nucleocapsid protein (N).
False	Although profilin released  <e1> actin </e1>  at the appropriate time to stimulate actin assembly during exposure to chemoattractants, the concentration of profilin in PMN was insufficient to explain the high unpolymerized actin content in unstimulated PMN and the quantity of  <e2> actin </e2>  released from profilin too small to account for the large shifts from unpolymerized to polymerized actin associated with maximal chemoattractant stimulation.
True	 <e1> alpha-SNAP </e1>  binds to predicted alpha-helical coiled-coil regions of  <e2> syntaxin </e2>  and SNAP-25, shown previously to be engaged in their direct interaction.
True	As expected, C/ATF was found to interact with three domains of  <e1> CBP </e1>  including  <e2> CREB </e2>  binding domain or kinase-inducible interaction (KIX) domain, the third cysteine-histidine-rich region (CH3 domain) and the nuclear receptor coactivator p160/SRC-1-interacting domain.
False	 <e1> PF4 </e1> -dependent downregulation of cyclin E-cdk2 activity was associated with increased binding of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(Cip1/WAF1), to the  <e2> cyclin E </e2> -cdk2 complex.
True	In addition, we also provide new evidence to suggest that  <e1> HRG </e1>  stimulation of the EF-1alpha promoter involves increased physical interactions with acetylated histone H3 and histone  <e2> H4 </e2> .
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that  <e1> histone </e1>  H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/ <e2> p300 </e2> , and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	These findings suggest that this novel  <e1> RhoGAP </e1>  is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of Rho activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  and profilin.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and  <e2> L </e2>  is the proposed transcriptase gene.

False	Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins with HECD-1 revealed three bands corresponding to  <e1> E-cadherin </e1> , alpha-catenin, and gamma-catenin and a 79-kDa band which was apparently smaller than that of normal  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , indicating truncated beta-catenin.
False	The same steady state concentrations of polymerized and nonpolymerized  <e1> actin </e1>  are reached whether  <e2> profilin </e2>  is added before initiation of polymerization or after polymerization is complete.
False	However, these mutants displayed a lower affinity for  <e1> actin </e1>  than wild-type profilin, suggesting that additional putative bonds created this way cannot increase  <e2> profilin </e2> 's affinity for actin.
True	Here, we show that PRP5 (a DEAD box helicase-like protein),  <e1> PRP9 </e1> , and PRP11 are each required for the  <e2> U2 snRNP </e2>  to bind to the pre-spliceosome during spliceosome assembly in vitro.
False	However, although expression of Ras alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of Ras with  <e1> Myc </e1>  allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the  <e2> p27 </e2>  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI).
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G-L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed  <e1> glycoprotein </e1>  gene; and  <e2> L </e2>  is the proposed transcriptase gene.
True	Three  <e1> actin </e1> -associated proteins, actin-binding protein,  <e2> gelsolin </e2> , and profilin, influence gelation, solation, and polymerization, respectively, of actin in vitro.
False	In extracts from mouse brain,  <e1> profilin I </e1>  and  <e2> profilin II </e2>  can form complexes with regulators of endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling and actin assembly.
False	One, MORT1 (also called FADD), binds to Fas/APO1 but not to p55-R; another, TRADD, binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to  <e1> Fas </e1> /APO1; and the third,  <e2> RIP </e2> , binds weakly to both receptors.

True	Interaction between  <e1> nucleocapsid protein </e1>  (NP) and phosphoprotein ( <e2> P </e2> ) of human parainfluenza virus type 2: one of the two NP binding sites on P is essential for granule formation.
False	This technique was employed to quantify changes caused by the lack of talin, a protein that couples the  <e1> actin </e1>  network to the plasma membrane, or by the lack of  <e2> cortexillin I </e2>  or II, two isoforms of the actin-bundling protein cortexillin.
True	The results clearly showed that the mutated cofilin possessing KTLKK instead of KKRKK did not translocate into the nuclei in response to heat shock whereas a recombinant  <e1> cofilin </e1>  with the unaltered sequence of KKRKK responded to heat shock and formed intranuclear rods together with  <e2> actin </e2> .

True	Within 1 hour of raising the concentration of calcium ions, integrins, cadherins, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin,  <e1> plakoglobin </e1> , vinculin and alpha-actinin appeared to accumulate at cell-cell borders, whereas the focal contact proteins,  <e2> paxillin </e2>  and talin, did not.
True	Co-precipitation experiments using whole cell lysates indicate that the mutant form of alpha-catenin binds beta-catenin and  <e1> plakoglobin </e1> , and can form a structural complex with  <e2> E-cadherin </e2>  via these interactions.
False	Adherens junction proteins (N-cadherin, E-cadherin, alpha-catenin,  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , plakoglobin, and  <e2> actin </e2> ) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were localized in the cultures by fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro wound healing was compared.
False	By 1 h the cells were well spread with straight  <e1> actin </e1>  bundles many of which ended at more central sites terminating on patches containing vinculin and  <e2> talin </e2> ; thus the cells assemble typical stress fibers but do not appear to polarize.

False	Actin-binding proteins such as  <e1> profilin </e1>  and gelsolin bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) and regulate the concentration of monomeric  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	Glutathione S-transferase pull-down performed with Tax deletion mutants and peptide competition have localized the site in Tax critical for binding CBP/ <e1> p300 </e1>  to a highly protease-sensitive region around amino acid residues 81 to 95 (81QRTSKTLKVLTPPIT95) which lies between the domains previously proposed to be important for CREB binding and  <e2> Tax </e2>  subunit dimerization.

True	In brush cells,  <e1> villin </e1>  and fimbrin are not only present in the  <e2> actin </e2>  filament core bundles of apical microvilli and their long rootlets but, in addition, both proteins are also associated with microvilli extending from the basolateral cell surface of the brush cells.
False	The interaction of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV)  <e1> phosphoprotein </e1>  ( <e2> P </e2> ) with nucleocapsid (N) and large polymerase (L) proteins was investigated using an intracellular BRSV-CAT minigenome replication system.

False	They had altered adhesive properties as measured by their ability to bind to a fibronectin-coated glass surface, suggesting that the expression of a rac-1 GAP alters the assembly of integrin receptors, actin and cytoskeletal proteins such as  <e1> vinculin </e1>  and  <e2> talin </e2> .
True	The mutants ranged in affinity, from those that only weakly affected polymerization of actin to one that bound  <e1> actin </e1>  more strongly than wild-type  <e2> profilin </e2> .
False	Because beta-catenin is known to interact with alpha-catenin, which binds to  <e1> actin </e1> , we generated a fusion molecule consisting of the ectodomain of E-cadherin and the actin binding site of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> .

True	Kinetic simulation showed that the  <e1> profilin </e1>  exchanges between  <e2> actin </e2>  monomers on a subsecond time scale that allows it to catalyze nucleotide exchange.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/ <e1> SLG1 </e1>  and  <e2> MID2 </e2>  also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	The two cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms, alpha and  <e1> beta </e1> , differ functionally,  <e2> alpha Myosin </e2>  exhibits higher actin-activated ATPase than does beta myosin, and hearts expressing alpha myosin exhibit increased contractility relative to hearts expressing beta myosin.
False	Our results showed that cell morphology, cell adhesion pattern, actin organization, and distribution of  <e1> integrin </e1>  subunits,  <e2> talin </e2> , vinculin, and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins are dependent on the supramolecular organization of the collagens.
True	Our results provide support for both physical and functional interactions between three subunits, TIF34,  <e1> PRT1 </e1>  and  <e2> p33 </e2> , in the eIF3 complex.
True	One, MORT1 (also called FADD), binds to  <e1> Fas </e1> /APO1 but not to p55-R; another, TRADD, binds to the p55 TNF receptor but not to Fas/APO1; and the third,  <e2> RIP </e2> , binds weakly to both receptors.
False	In these investigations, we determine that recruitment of a coactivator protein, CBP (the CREBbinding protein), to the CYBB or NCF2 promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by  <e1> PU.1 </e1> ,  <e2> IRF1 </e2> , and ICSBP.
True	mDia binds  <e1> profilin </e1>  likely to promote  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a- <e1> 4b </e1> -M- <e2> G </e2> -L-5', where N is the nucleocapsid protein gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.

False	Here, we designed a genetic screen for mutant strains defective for filamentous growth (dfg) to identify novel targets of the filamentation signaling pathway, and we thereby identified 16 different genes, CDC39, STE12, TEC1,  <e1> WHI3 </e1> , NAB1, DBR1, CDC55, SRV2, TPM1, SPA2, BNI1, DFG5,  <e2> DFG9 </e2> , DFG10, BUD8 and DFG16, mutations that block filamentous growth.
True	This technique was employed to quantify changes caused by the lack of talin, a protein that couples the actin network to the plasma membrane, or by the lack of  <e1> cortexillin I </e1>  or II, two isoforms of the actin-bundling protein  <e2> cortexillin </e2> .
False	We describe the localization of  <e1> cadherin-11 </e1>  and N-cadherin along the cell margins of mouse osteoblast-like cells, the colocalization of "pancadherin" with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, p120, and  <e2> vinculin </e2> , and the association of these complexes with the actin microfilaments.
False	NLS-less S.cerevisiae proteins include both RAD51 and RAD52 that function in the recombination and in the repair of double-strand breaks as well as the  <e1> RAD23 </e1>  and  <e2> HRR25 </e2>  molecules.
True	The colocalization of  <e1> gelsolin </e1>  and  <e2> profilin </e2>  in motile, microfilament-rich areas supports the hypothesis that they synergistically regulate the actin dynamics that underlie neurite growth.
False	This model includes two different Kd's--one for  <e1> profilin </e1>  bound to actin monomers and one for profilin bound to an  <e2> actin </e2>  molecule at the barbed end of a filament.
False	These findings suggest that this novel RhoGAP is involved in the Rho signalling pathway, probably downstream of  <e1> Rho </e1>  activation, and mediates the stimulation of PLC-delta, which leads to actin-related cytoskeletal changes through the hydrolysis of PIP2, which binds to actin binding proteins such as  <e2> gelsolin </e2>  and profilin.
False	Isolation and characterization of death domain ( <e1> TNF-RI </e1> , Fas, TRADD, FADD/MORT-1, RIP) and TRAF domain-containing proteins (TRAF-1,  <e2> TRAF-2 </e2> , TRAF-3) have partially bridged a large molecular gap within one of several signaling pathways which originate at the plasma membrane and terminate in the nucleus.
False	A further outcome of this study is that the  <e1> actin </e1>  filament core bundles in microvilli of chicken pigment epithelial cells are presumed to contain a crosslinking protein, which is not immunologically related to either  <e2> villin </e2> , fimbrin or myosin I of the intestinal brush border.

False	RAD51,  <e1> RAD54 </e1> ,  <e2> RAD55 </e2>  and RAD57 are all required to facilitate strand invasion into otherwise inaccessible donor sequences.
False	These studies suggest that profilin and  <e1> gelsolin </e1>  may control the generation of 3-OH phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn may regulate the  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization.
False	Chick embryo fibroblasts contain about 75-100 microM unpolymerized actin and at least four proteins which can bind actin monomers, actin depolymerizing factor (ADF),  <e1> gelsolin </e1> , profilin, and  <e2> thymosin beta4 </e2>  (Tbeta4).
True	Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins with  <e1> HECD-1 </e1>  revealed three bands corresponding to E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and gamma-catenin and a 79-kDa band which was apparently smaller than that of normal beta-catenin, indicating truncated  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> .
True	To investigate the possibility that TD77 disrupts  <e1> actin </e1>  stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional  <e2> talin </e2>  fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and actin binding.
True	The position of the actin-binding site at the C terminal suggests that  <e1> talin </e1>  may work as a crosslinker between  <e2> myosin </e2>  and actin.
False	However, although expression of  <e1> Ras </e1>  alone will not induce G1 CDK activity or S phase, coexpression of  <e2> Ras </e2>  with Myc allows the generation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity and the induction of S phase, coincident with the loss of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI).
True	This mutant  <e1> profilin I </e1>  suppresses  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization in microspike formation induced by N-WASP, the essential factor in microspike formation.

False	We report here that tropomyosin, which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the  <e1> actin </e1>  of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the  <e2> villin </e2>  and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect actin binding by 110-kD calmodulin.
False	Gel electrophoresis was used to measure changes in the relative amounts of actin or myosin and of  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1>  ( <e2> MHC </e2> ) isoforms.

False	These results suggest that TNF-alpha can cause apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells through  <e1> TNFR1 </e1> -linked apoptotic factors, TRADD, FADD, and FLICE, and  <e2> TNF </e2> -induced ceramide production may be involved in the pathways.
False	Analyses of beta-catenin or E-cadherin immunoprecipitates from BMMC lysate revealed that  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , beta-catenin, and E-cadherin were co-precipitated, suggesting that E-cadherin and  <e2> catenins </e2>  form a complex in mast cells.
False	The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin cannot directly associate with alpha-catenin but interacts with high affinity with  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> , whereas the binding of gamma-catenin ( <e2> plakoglobin </e2> ) to E-cadherin is less efficient.
False	Seventeen embryonic genes were identified as  <e1> embryonic alpha-tubulin </e1> , embryonic beta-tubulin, hnRNP, protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase ( <e2> PIMT </e2> ), ferritin heavy chain, type IV collagen, actin-binding protein cofilin, profilin and nine novel sequences designated as A1-9.

False	We have shown that the FH proteins Bni1p and Bnr1p are potential targets of the  <e1> Rho </e1>  family small GTP-binding proteins and bind to an actin-binding protein, profilin, at their proline-rich FH1 domains to regulate reorganization of the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
False	NLS-less S.cerevisiae proteins include both  <e1> RAD51 </e1>  and RAD52 that function in the recombination and in the repair of double-strand breaks as well as the  <e2> RAD23 </e2>  and HRR25 molecules.

False	Moreover, in the presence of  <e1> cofilin </e1> , rapid interconversion of monomeric and polymeric forms of  <e2> actin </e2>  can be induced by simply changing the pH of the medium.
True	Here, we show that  <e1> EID-1 </e1>  is a potent inhibitor of differentiation and link this activity to its ability to inhibit p300 (and the highly related molecule, CREB-binding protein, or CBP)  <e2> histone </e2>  acetylation activity.
False	These proteins also compose the essential heterotrimeric splicing factor SF3a, and products of yeast pre-mRNA processing genes PRP9,  <e1> PRP11 </e1> , and  <e2> PRP21 </e2>  are their likely yeast counterparts.
False	We report here that LIMK1 and LIMK2 phosphorylate both cofilin and  <e1> actin-depolymerizing factor </e1>  (ADF) specifically at Ser-3 and exhibit partially distinct substrate specificity when tested using site-directed  <e2> cofilin </e2>  mutants as substrates.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5,  <e1> DPB11 </e1> , MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and  <e2> MAD3 </e2>  had little effect.
False	Lethality of the  <e1> srs2Delta </e1>   <e2> rad54Delta </e2>  and srs2Delta rdh54Delta double mutants can also be rescued by mutations in the DNA damage checkpoint functions RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, indicating that the srs2 rad54 and srs2 rdh54 mutant combinations lead to an intermediate that is sensed by these checkpoint functions.
True	 <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  inhibits beta-catenin signaling by preventing formation of a  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> *T-cell factor*DNA complex.
True	Within 1 hour of raising the concentration of calcium ions, integrins, cadherins,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> , beta-catenin, plakoglobin,  <e2> vinculin </e2>  and alpha-actinin appeared to accumulate at cell-cell borders, whereas the focal contact proteins, paxillin and talin, did not.
False	The cellular transcription co-activators  <e1> p300 </e1>  and the  <e2> CREB-binding protein </e2>  CBP are cellular targets for transformation by the E1A proteins of non-oncogenic adenovirus 5 (Ad5).
False	We report here that tropomyosin, which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core, can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores, and can cause the dissociation of up to 30% of the villin and  <e1> fimbrin </e1>  from the cores but does not affect actin binding by 110-kD  <e2> calmodulin </e2> .
False	In search for genes which might participate in chicken immunoglobulin gene conversion, we have identified chicken counterparts of the yeast RAD51,  <e1> RAD52 </e1> , and  <e2> RAD54 </e2>  genes.
False	Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on  <e1> muscle actin </e1> , requiring 5 to 10 times more  <e2> profilin </e2>  than with amoeba actin.
False	On the basis of these results, we present a model for prereplicative site formation in infected cells in which the  <e1> helicase-primase </e1>  components (UL5, UL8, and UL52), the  <e2> origin-binding protein </e2>  (UL9), and the viral single-stranded DNA-binding protein (ICP8) assemble together to initiate the process.
False	The results indicate that (a) plakoglobin and beta-catenin differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with  <e1> LEF-1 </e1>  and vinculin; (b) LEF-1-dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by beta-catenin; and (c) the cytoplasmic partners of beta-catenin,  <e2> cadherin </e2>  and alpha-catenin, can sequester it to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38  <e1> MAPK </e1> , may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <e2> IL-2 </e2>  production.
False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone  <e1> H3 </e1> , was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/ <e2> waf1 </e2>  in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin,  <e1> p120 </e1> (cas) or alpha-catenin, becomes stabilized when  <e2> proteasome </e2> -mediated proteolysis is inhibited and this leads to the accumulation of multi-ubiquitinated forms of beta-catenin.
True	Motile areas of leech neurites are rich in microfilaments and two  <e1> actin-binding proteins </e1> : gelsolin and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
True	In addition, we also provide new evidence to suggest that HRG stimulation of the EF-1alpha promoter involves increased physical interactions with acetylated histone H3 and  <e1> histone </e1>   <e2> H4 </e2> .
False	In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry on sectioned  <e1> Myf-5 </e1>  and MyoD mutant embryos with antibodies reactive with  <e2> desmin </e2> , nestin, myosin heavy chain, sarcomeric actin, Myf-5, MyoD and myogenin.
False	Here we show that the N-terminal domain of ActA binds one  <e1> actin </e1>  monomer, in a profilin-like fashion, and Arp2/3 complex and mimics the C-terminal domain of  <e2> WASp </e2>  family proteins in catalyzing filament barbed end branching by Arp2/3 complex.
True	The interaction between calf  <e1> spleen profilin </e1>  and  <e2> actin </e2>  depends critically on the status of the C-terminus of the actin, and in the case of profilin, the C-terminus is of great importance for the physiochemical behaviour of the protein.
True	Protein phosphorylation of  <e1> cofilin </e1> , an actin-binding protein that depolymerizes  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments, suppresses its function.
False	Recently it has been established, through a detailed biochemical analysis, that recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana  <e1> fimbrin 1 </e1>  (AtFim1) is a member of the fimbrin/plastin family of  <e2> actin </e2>  filament bundling or cross-linking proteins [D.R. Kovar et al. (2000) Plant J 24:625-636].
True	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to beta-catenin/plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/ <e1> catenin </e1>  complex to the  <e2> actin </e2>  cytoskeleton.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked  <e1> PKC1 </e1>  as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2,  <e2> HCS77 </e2> /WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	The tandem repeat domain in the Listeria monocytogenes ActA protein controls the rate of  <e1> actin </e1> -based motility, the percentage of moving bacteria, and the localization of  <e2> vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein </e2>  and profilin.
False	In the present work we have used profilin and  <e1> DNAse I </e1>  injections, as well as latrunculin B and cytochalasin D treatments, under quantitatively controlled conditions, to perturb  <e2> actin </e2>  microfilament structure and assembly in an attempt to answer this question.
False	These  <e1> histone </e1>  H3 and H2a genes encode approximately 40% of the total H3 and H2a mRNA, whereas the histone  <e2> H4 </e2>  and histone H2b genes encode < 10% of the total H4 and H2b mRNA.
True	These dissociation constants are the first to be determined from direct physical measurement; they are in agreement with values inferred from earlier studies on the effect of  <e1> profilin </e1>  on the assembly of  <e2> actin </e2>  that had been fluorescently labeled or otherwise modified at Cys 374.
False	Compared with control and contralateral kidneys, the ligated kidneys displayed a dynamic expression of mRNAs for many apoptosis-related molecules, which included an up to threefold increase for Fas, Fas ligand, TNF-R1,  <e1> TRAIL </e1> , TRADD,  <e2> RIP </e2> , and caspase-8, and an up to twofold increase for FADD and FAP, but there was little change for FAF.

False	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as  <e1> gelsolin </e1>  and  <e2> profilin </e2> .

False	Immunoprecipitation with an  <e1> E-cadherin </e1>  mAb, which is known to co-precipitate the catenins, demonstrated that the three poorly differentiated cell lines expressing E-cadherin did not co-precipitate  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2> , although all of the moderately-well differentiated cell lines expressed both alpha- and beta-catenin.

False	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the  <e1> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </e1>  p27, enhanced association of p27 with cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/CDK2 (but not to  <e2> cyclin D3 </e2> /CDK4).
False	Study of mutated yeast  <e1> profilins </e1>  and profilins from Acanthamoeba suggests that the ability of profilin to suppress  <e2> cap- </e2>  cells is dependent upon a property other than, or in addition to, its ability to bind actin.

False	On the other hand, polymerization assays give disparate results that are inconsistent with the binding assays and each other: profilin has different effects on elongation at the two ends of actin filaments; profilin inhibits the elongation of platelet actin much more strongly than  <e1> muscle actin </e1> ; and simple formation of 1:1 complexes of  <e2> actin </e2>  with profilin cannot account for the strong inhibition of spontaneous polymerization.
True	The resulting  <e1> profilin II </e1> -peptide complex overcomes the combined capacity of thymosin beta4 and profilin II to inhibit  <e2> actin </e2>  nucleation and restores the extent of filament formation.

False	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not histone H3, was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that  <e1> CBP </e1> /p300, and not the  <e2> SAGA </e2>  complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 (MAP kinase) mimicked PKC1 as a  <e1> glc7-10 </e1>  dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as ROM2, RHO2, HCS77/ <e2> WSC1 </e2> /SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.

True	In investigating the mechanism by which pRb induces senescence, we have found that  <e1> pRb </e1>  causes a posttranscriptional accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27( <e2> KIP1 </e2> ) that is accompanied by an increase in p27(KIP1) specifically bound to cyclin E and a concomitant decrease in cyclin E-associated kinase activity.
False	By this method, it was shown that four of these large RNA species are polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from two genes: one species contains nucleocapsid protein (NP) and phosphoprotein (P) gene sequences; another, P and membrane protein (M) gene sequences; another,  <e1> M </e1>  and fusion protein (F0) gene sequences; and another, F0 and  <e2> hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein </e2>  (HN) gene sequences.

False	The results clearly showed that the mutated  <e1> cofilin </e1>  possessing KTLKK instead of KKRKK did not translocate into the nuclei in response to heat shock whereas a recombinant cofilin with the unaltered sequence of KKRKK responded to heat shock and formed intranuclear rods together with  <e2> actin </e2> .
False	In contrast, act1-159 partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in  <e1> fimbrin </e1> ,  <e2> Mdm20p </e2> , and tropomyosin null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these actin-binding proteins.
False	Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53,  <e1> CHK1 </e1> , PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9,  <e2> RAD17 </e2> , RAD24, BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect.
False	Immunohistochemistry for a variety of cytokeratins (CKs) (8/18, 1/10, 7, and 20), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA),  <e1> S-100 </e1>  protein, vimentin CD34,  <e2> type IV collagen </e2> , smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and glial fibrillary acid protein was performed.

False	Rod formation was prevented by coexpression of  <e1> N-cadherin </e1> , APC, and Tcf-4, which bind to the  <e2> armadillo </e2>  repeats of beta-catenin, but not by coexpression of alpha-catenin, although alpha-catenin expression did prevent accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus.

False	Motile areas of leech neurites are rich in microfilaments and two actin-binding proteins:  <e1> gelsolin </e1>  and  <e2> profilin </e2> .
False	However, some proteins (e.g.,  <e1> profilin </e1> ) and other agents (e.g., cytochalasin D) that bind to actin are affected by the presence of fluorescent labels, making actin intrinsic fluorescence potentially useful in investigating the interaction of these agents with actin, and in validating data obtained using labeled  <e2> actin </e2> .

False	The very much lower affinity of profilin for modified actin explains the anomalous critical concentrations curves obtained for 5-10% pyrenyl-labeled  <e1> actin </e1>  in the presence of profilin and the apparently weak inhibition by  <e2> profilin </e2>  of the rate of filament elongation when polymerization is quantified by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin.

False	Direct binding of the  <e1> verprolin </e1> -homology domain in N-WASP to  <e2> actin </e2>  is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization.
True	Hypertonicity provoked  <e1> Fyn </e1> -dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in beta-catenin, alpha-catenin, and  <e2> p120 </e2> (Cas) and caused the dissociation of beta-catenin from the contacts.

False	Our data strongly support the view that the mobile form of  <e1> actin </e1>  in slow transport is soluble and that a substantial amount of this actin may travel as a complex with  <e2> actin depolymerizing factor </e2> , cofilin, and profilin.
True	However, some proteins (e.g.,  <e1> profilin </e1> ) and other agents (e.g., cytochalasin D) that bind to  <e2> actin </e2>  are affected by the presence of fluorescent labels, making actin intrinsic fluorescence potentially useful in investigating the interaction of these agents with actin, and in validating data obtained using labeled actin.

True	Because histone H3 shares many structural features with  <e1> histone </e1>   <e2> H4 </e2>  and is intimately associated with H4 in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether H3 has similar functions.
False	Panels of six to 31 MAbs against the haemagglutinin (H), fusion (F), nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M)  <e1> proteins </e1>  of MV and the H, F, NP and P  <e2> proteins </e2>  of CDV were employed.

True	They had altered adhesive properties as measured by their ability to bind to a fibronectin-coated glass surface, suggesting that the expression of a  <e1> rac-1 GAP </e1>  alters the assembly of integrin receptors,  <e2> actin </e2>  and cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin and talin.
True	TNF receptor death domain-associated proteins TRADD and  <e1> FADD </e1>  signal activation of  <e2> acid sphingomyelinase </e2> .

False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase ( <e1> MAPK </e1> )/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38 MAPK, may be involved in the  <e2> muscarinic receptor </e2> -mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.
True	These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and PIP  <e1> kinases </e1>  and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of  <e2> actin </e2>  in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.
False	The contents of  <e1> myosin heavy chain </e1> , myosin light chain 2,  <e2> actin </e2> , troponin-I in 125-week-old rats decreased compared with those of 12-week-old rats.

False	Transcriptional expression of TNFR1(p55), as well as that of FLICE, Fas, FADD,  <e1> DR3 </e1> , FAF, TRADD, and  <e2> RIP </e2>  was similar in these cell lines, indicating that the susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis may not be determined by the constitutive expression level of these factors.
False	We used yeast as a model to test this hypothesis and found that chromosome deletion of any known nuclear mitotic mismatch repair genes, including  <e1> MLH1 </e1> , MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and PMS1, did not rescue  <e2> mgt1 </e2> delta O6 MeG DNA repair methyltransferase-deficient cells from killing by MNNG.

False	In most cases, ADF and cofilin colocalized in the same nuclear  <e1> actin </e1>  rods, but  <e2> ADF </e2>  appeared to predominate in mononucleated cells, while cofilin was present in multinucleated myotubes.
False	In this  <e1> actin </e1>  clustering, profilin, a monomeric actin-binding protein that has been suggested to be involved in  <e2> actin </e2>  polymerization, was shown to be essential.
False	These cells have both  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1>  and  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , display unusual expression of N-cadherin, and have the typical fibroblastic phenotype of transformed cells.
False	The results indicate that (a) plakoglobin and beta-catenin differ in their nuclear translocation and complexing with LEF-1 and  <e1> vinculin </e1> ; (b)  <e2> LEF-1 </e2> -dependent transactivation is preferentially driven by beta-catenin; and (c) the cytoplasmic partners of beta-catenin, cadherin and alpha-catenin, can sequester it to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity.
False	Panels of six to 31 MAbs against the haemagglutinin (H), fusion (F), nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein ( <e1> P </e1> ) and matrix (M)  <e2> proteins </e2>  of MV and the H, F, NP and P proteins of CDV were employed.

True	The in vitro and in vivo binding patterns were highly similar, and the association of the Munc18-2 variants with  <e1> syntaxin 3 </e1>  correlated well with their ability to displace  <e2> SNAP-23 </e2>  from syntaxin 3 complexes when overexpressed in Caco-2 cells.
False	To investigate the role of cofilin in EGF-stimulated  <e1> actin </e1>  polymerization and lamellipod extension in MTLn3 cells, we examined in detail the temporal and spatial distribution of cofilin relative to free barbed ends and characterized the  <e2> actin </e2>  dynamics by measuring the changes in the number of actin filaments.
False	To characterize the AAV functions mediating this effect, cloned AAV type 2 wild-type or mutant genomes were transfected into simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed hamster cells together with the six HSV replication genes (encoding  <e1> UL5 </e1> , UL8,  <e2> major DNA-binding protein </e2> , DNA polymerase, UL42, and UL52) which together are necessary and sufficient for the induction of SV40 DNA amplification (R. Heilbronn and H. zur Hausen, J. Virol. 63:3683-3692, 1989).
False	The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A,  <e1> H2B </e1> , H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3;  <e2> histones </e2>  H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity.
False	The proposed LNYV genomic map is 3'-N-4a-4b-M-G- <e1> L </e1> -5', where N is the  <e2> nucleocapsid protein </e2>  gene; 4a and 4b are two genes, one of which codes for the proposed phosphoprotein P and the other for a putative protein of unknown function; M is the proposed matrix protein gene; G is the proposed glycoprotein gene; and L is the proposed transcriptase gene.

False	The most striking difference was in the relative preference for acetylation of histone H4 versus acetylation of  <e1> histone </e1>  H3: with the purified acetylase, histone H4 in nucleosomes was acetylated to a much greater extent than was histone  <e2> H3 </e2> , whereas the reverse preference was found with the endogenous acetylase(s).
True	The aim of our study on human seminiferous tubules of adolescent testes was to study the localization of two  <e1> actin </e1> -associated proteins of the adherens junctions, such as  <e2> vinculin </e2>  and talin, and to verify if there were modifications in their pattern in varicocele, a frequent disease of the testis in adolescent age.
False	The core histones from Physarum,  <e1> histones </e1>  H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones H2A and  <e2> H2B </e2>  show less heterogeneity.

False	 <e1> HGF </e1> /SF treatment of LoVo reduced the amount of  <e2> alpha-catenin </e2>  complexed with E-cadherin more markedly than in L-10, but in both cell lines this reduction was not accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin, suggesting the presence of a mechanism other than phosphorylation for release from cell-cell adhesion during cell motility.
False	Although binding patterns of different sera were not identical, almost all sera caused IgG binding to platelet components of 87-90 kD, 140 kD (identified as  <e1> vinculin </e1> ) and 220-240 kD (tentatively identified as talin and  <e2> actin-binding protein </e2> ).

False	Cofilin was identified by peptide sequencing, and  <e1> cofilin </e1>  recruitment and Listeria tail length were found to be pH-dependent, in agreement with its recently reported role in enhancing  <e2> actin </e2>  filament turnover.
True	Our data indicate that even profilins of highly distant evolutionary origin can functionally substitute for each other and support the hypothesis that in animal cells,  <e1> profilins </e1>  are engaged in regulating either the stability or the kinetic properties of  <e2> actin </e2>  filaments.

True	There are only 14 non-conservative substitutions in the two  <e1> myosin heavy chains </e1> , three of which are located in the secondary  <e2> actin </e2> -binding loop and flanking regions and others correspond to residues so far not assigned a functional role, including two residues in the proximal S2 domain.
False	Although neither activation of BCK1 (MEKK) by the dominant BCK1-20 mutation nor increased dosage of MKK1 (MEK) or MPK1 ( <e1> MAP kinase </e1> ) mimicked PKC1 as a glc7-10 dosage suppressor, extra copies of genes encoding upstream components of the Pkc1p pathway such as  <e2> ROM2 </e2> , RHO2, HCS77/WSC1/SLG1 and MID2 also suppressed glc7-10 effectively.
False	In this study the role of MSH2, MSH3, and  <e1> MSH6 </e1>  in mismatch repair has been examined by measuring the rate of accumulating mutations and mutation spectrum in strains containing different combinations of msh2, msh3, and  <e2> msh6 </e2>  mutations and by studying the physical interaction between the MSH2 protein and the MSH3 and MSH6 proteins.
False	beta-catenin or plakoglobin is associated directly with the cadherin; alpha-catenin binds to  <e1> beta-catenin </e1> /plakoglobin and serves to link the cadherin/ <e2> catenin </e2>  complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

False	In cell extracts, we found that complementary strand synthesis was inhibited by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) and rescued by the addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, arguing for the involvement of DNA polymerase ( <e1> Pol </e1> )  <e2> delta </e2>  in the conversion reaction.
True	act1-157, an  <e1> actin </e1>  mutant with an increased intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, suppressed defects in actin organization, cell growth, and fluid-phase endocytosis of pfy1-4, a  <e2> profilin </e2>  mutant defective in actin binding.
True	By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we observed that histone H4, and not  <e1> histone </e1>   <e2> H3 </e2> , was acetylated from the endogenous p21/waf1 promoter in vivo, implying that CBP/p300, and not the SAGA complex, was critical in complexing with E2A in up-regulation of p21/waf1 in HTLV-1-infected cells.

False	To clarify the relation between alteration of expression of cell adhesion molecules and progression of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas 55 cases were immunohistochemically examined for E-cadherin,  <e1> alpha-catenin </e1> ,  <e2> beta-catenin </e2> , and CD44, with additional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting hybridization (RT-PCR/SBH) assays.
False	In order to determine possible changes in the cytoskeleton organization and function during these processes, we have studied the in situ distribution of two major cytoskeleton-associated elements involved in the membrane anchorage of actin microfilaments, i.e.  <e1> vinculin </e1>  and  <e2> talin </e2> , during the ontogeny of the neural crest and its derivatives in the avian embryo.

True	In contrast,  <e1> act1-159 </e1>  partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin mutant, and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in fimbrin,  <e2> Mdm20p </e2> , and tropomyosin null mutants, suggesting filament stabilizing functions for these actin-binding proteins.
False	Using the 'nuclear displacement assay' as a measure of the integrity of the  <e1> actin </e1>  cytoskeleton in living stamen hair cells, we demonstrated that  <e2> AtFim1 </e2>  protects actin filaments in these cells from Z. mays profilin (ZmPRO5)-induced depolymerization, in a dose-dependent manner.
False	The findings suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of  <e1> IL-2 </e1>  production in Jurkat cells and that the transcription factor AP-1 and pathways via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not via p38  <e2> MAPK </e2> , may be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of IL-2 production.

False	Here we demonstrate that growth arrest and differentiation of NT2/D1 cells induced by HMBA involve increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, enhanced association of p27 with  <e1> cyclin E </e1> /CDK2 complexes and suppression of kinase activity associated to cyclin E/ <e2> CDK2 </e2>  (but not to cyclin D3/CDK4).
True	Phosphorylation of  <e1> profilin </e1>  by PKC was not affected by the presence of various concentrations of  <e2> actin </e2> .

False	Gravin is not likely to be a  <e1> nonerythroid spectrin </e1> , talin,  <e2> myosin </e2> , or actin-binding protein based on the lack of reactivity of antigravin with these polypeptides in immunoblots.
False	Isolation and characterization of death domain (TNF-RI, Fas,  <e1> TRADD </e1> , FADD/MORT-1,  <e2> RIP </e2> ) and TRAF domain-containing proteins (TRAF-1, TRAF-2, TRAF-3) have partially bridged a large molecular gap within one of several signaling pathways which originate at the plasma membrane and terminate in the nucleus.
False	Sequence analysis of the genes encoding the  <e1> nucleocapsid protein </e1>  and phosphoprotein (P) of phocid distemper virus, and editing of the  <e2> P </e2>  gene transcript.
False	Complete gene sequences for the nucleocapsid protein (N) and phosphoprotein (P/V) have been determined and recombinant  <e1> N </e1>  and  <e2> V </e2>  proteins produced in baculovirus.
False	METHODS: Tumor samples from 77 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were immunohistochemically evaluated for the expression of 10 molecules: the cell cycle-related molecules of  <e1> cyclin D1 </e1> , Rb,  <e2> p16INK4 </e2> , p27KIP1, and PCNA; the cell-cell adhesion molecules of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin; and the heat shock proteins of HSP27 and HSP70.
False	To investigate the possibility that  <e1> TD77 </e1>  disrupts actin stress fibers by binding directly to the C-terminal actin binding site, additional talin fusion proteins were generated and analyzed for TD77 and  <e2> actin </e2>  binding.
