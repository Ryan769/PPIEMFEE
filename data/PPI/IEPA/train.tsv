True	The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated  <e1> insulin </e1>  secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of  <e2> PLC </e2>  isoforms.
False	We examined for the first time in young men effects of intravenous injections of  <e1> NPY </e1>  (4x50 or 100 microg, n = 9 and 11, respectively, at 22.00, 23.00, 24.00 and 01.00 compared to saline) on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG; recorded from 23.00 to 07.00) and nocturnal secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, growth hormone (GH), prolactin and  <e2> leptin </e2> 
True	These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of  <e1> leptin </e1>  on muscle  <e2> UCP-3 </e2>  expression
True	Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and  <e1> insulin </e1>  in response to  <e2> oxytocin </e2>  treatment
False	The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of  <e1> UCP2 </e1>  in EWAT and that of  <e2> UCP1 </e2> , UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT
True	A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking  <e1> leptin </e1> -induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle  <e2> uncoupling protein-3 </e2>  (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3

False	We conclude that: (1)  <e1> AVP </e1>  causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does  <e2> PKC </e2>  trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.
False	These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2,  <e1> leptin </e1> ,  <e2> UCP-2 </e2> , UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins
False	Association of the insulin receptor with  <e1> phospholipase C-gamma </e1>  (PLCgamma) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes suggests a role for  <e2> PLCgamma </e2>  in metabolic signaling by insulin

False	U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the  <e1> Oxy </e1> -induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the  <e2> Oxy </e2> -induced increase in insulin release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively

False	The resulting abnormally phosphorylated  <e1> PrPsc </e1>  aggregates to freshly synthesized PrPc, transforming it into same; due to a system of positive feedback invoked by the organophosphate-induced blockage of a  <e2> prion protein </e2> -specific protein kinase.
True	CONCLUSION: PTH,  <e1> AVP </e1> , PGE2, and adenosine stimulate Ca2+ reabsorption via a pathway that is independent of cAMP and that involves a phorbol ester-insensitive  <e2> PKC </e2>  isotype

True	The results demonstrate that potent antioxidants, such as  <e1> flavonoids </e1> , protect MM-LDL from lipoperoxidation and preserve their ability to efficiently deliver  <e2> cholesterol </e2>  to cells
False	Because the effect of carbachol on  <e1> insulin </e1>  secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of  <e2> PLC </e2> -beta1  or -beta3.
False	The body mass index (BMI),  <e1> leptin </e1> , plasma  <e2> neuropeptide Y </e2>  (NPY), serotonin, thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) in serum were evaluated for each subject

False	To determine whether UCP-2 does, in fact, have uncoupling activity and, if so, whether such activity would favorably influence the abnormalities in leptin-unresponsive  <e1> UCP-2 </e1> -underexpressing islets of diabetic ZDF rats, we transferred the  <e2> UCP-2 </e2>  gene to the islets of diabetic ZDF rats and lean (+/+) ZDF control rats
True	The highest dose of hCG plus The highest dose of hCG plus  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  provoked accumulation of total [3H] <e2> inositol phosphate </e2>  (p < 0.05) 53% over the basal level on days 21/1 of the estrous cycle
False	The  <e1> phospholipase C </e1>  inhibitor U 71322 prevented the activation of phospholipase C by  <e2> A beta P </e2> 
True	We suggest that  <e1> AVP </e1>  activates the 42/44kDa MAPKs through a signal transduction pathway that involves stimulation of AVP-V1 receptor, tyrosine kinase,  <e2> PKC </e2>  and MEK
False	Pretreatment of HEK-293 cells for 2 min with carbachol, a mAChR agonist, lysophosphatidic acid, or ATP, followed by agonist washout, strongly increased (by 2-3-fold) maximal  <e1> PLC </e1>  stimulation (measured >/=40 min later) by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, but not insulin, and largely enhanced  <e2> PLC </e2>  sensitivity to these RTK agonists
False	This effect is maximal at 10(-8) M AVP (a concentration clearly above the normal physiological range of  <e1> AVP </e1>  concentrations) and involves the V2 receptor pathway, while activation of  <e2> protein kinase C </e2>  or changes in intracellular calcium are ineffective

False	The low-performing Stock B animals were characterized by [1] being more reactive to sensory stimulation: higher startle amplitude and shorter startle latency; [2] having higher plasma  <e1> insulin </e1>  and corticosterone levels, whereas plasma gastrin and  <e2> oxytocin </e2>  were significantly lowered and a strong tendency for a decrease also in plasma CCK
True	AIM: To study the mechanisms underlying  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  (Oxy)-induced  <e2> insulin </e2>  release
True	A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of  <e1> leptin </e1>  prevented such a decrease in  <e2> UCP-3 </e2> 
False	The data suggest that mammalian  <e1> insulin </e1> -sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and  <e2> GPI-PLC </e2> ) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase
False	SP ewes also had greater incorporation of [3H]inositol into  <e1> inositol trisphosphate </e1>  (IP3) (+3449%, p less than 0.01) and total  <e2> inositol phosphate </e2>  (IP) (+760%, p less than 0.08), in response to oxytocin, than did oCSP ewes (+553 and +168% for IP3 and total IP, respectively) in endometrium collected at ovariectomy/hysterectomy on Day 16

True	 <e1> Oxytocin </e1>  (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) stimulate insulin and glucagon release from the pancreas, and evoke  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion from the rat insulinoma cell line, RINm5F
False	When  <e1> leptin </e1>  signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the  <e2> NPY </e2>  system is upregulated as shown by mRNA overexpression and increased peptide release, whereas the content and/or release of some inhibitory peptides (neurotensin, cholecystokinin) are diminished.
False	We aimed at studying the effects of  <e1> leptin </e1> , CART and  <e2> NPY </e2>  on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system.

False	Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced  <e1> insulin </e1>  release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the  <e2> PLC </e2>  signal pathway
False	 <e1> Insulin </e1>  secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion
True	These data indicate a GABAergic mediation of the inhibitory modulation by NO of the AVP and  <e1> OT </e1>  responses to  <e2> insulin </e2> -induced hypoglycemia
True	 <e1> Leptin </e1>  by intravenous or intracerebroventricular infusion for 5 h was associated with a decrease in UCP-2 mRNA in WAT (47-52%) and  <e2> UCP-3 </e2>  mRNA in SM (33-37%)
True	 <e1> OT </e1>  may rapidly stimulate  <e2> inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate </e2>  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation, consistent with the concept of rapid activation of a second-messenger system
False	NPY in the PVN increases feeding and decreases  <e1> uncoupling protein </e1>  (UCP) activity in brown fat, whereas  <e2> leptin </e2>  decreases NPY biosynthesis in the Arc, which presumably decreases PVN NPY
False	Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by  <e1> PKC </e1>  in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with  <e2> PKC </e2>  translocation and the release of ACTH
True	The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced  <e1> insulin </e1>  secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system
False	Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular  <e1> prion protein </e1>  isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a  <e2> prion protein </e2> -specific kinase
False	When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of  <e1> PLC </e1>  in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion
False	Moreover, A beta 25-35 had no effect on basal  <e1> PIP2-PLC </e1>  activity and cytosolic PI-PLC and  <e2> PIP2-PLC </e2> 
False	Despite the low levels of  <e1> insulin </e1> -induced PLC activity,  <e2> insulin </e2> -stimulated glucose transport activity was similarly inhibited by U73122 (55.9 +/- 13.1% inhibition)
False	We examined plasma  <e1> leptin </e1> ,  <e2> leptin </e2>  mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system
True	The aim of the present study was to investigate how  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of  <e2> insulin </e2> , glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms
False	 <e1> Phospholipase C </e1>  (PLC) activity was investigated by stimulation of membrane preparations obtained from  <e2> insulin </e2>  (beta-TC3)-, somatostatin (Rin 1027-B2)-, and glucagon (INR1-G9)-producing pancreatic cell lines using the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPgammaS alone, the C-terminal octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK-8), or gastrin
True	The  <e1> insulin </e1>  concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and  <e2> GPI-PLC </e2>  activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation

False	Many studies have indicated that  <e1> neuropeptide Y </e1>  (NPY) stimulates and  <e2> leptin </e2>  inhibits food intake
True	Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous  <e1> insulin </e1>  secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates  <e2> OT </e2>  secretion
True	 <e1> AVP </e1> - or TPA-induced activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK were completely blocked by down-regulation of  <e2> PKCalpha </e2> , betaI, epsilon, and delta, but still occurred, together with the cytosolic PLA2 mobility shift, in the absence of external Ca2+

False	The expression of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 were up-regulated by 3.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, during the late stage of pregnancy with an increase of WAT  <e1> leptin </e1>  mRNA expression and exogenous administration of  <e2> leptin </e2>  resulted in induction of the uterine UCP2 and UCP3 levels
False	Fasting, with or without  <e1> leptin </e1>  administration, did not affect BAT UCP-2 mRNA; however,  <e2> leptin </e2>  administration to ad libitum fed rats significantly increased BAT UCP-2 mRNA, to 138% of control
False	This action of  <e1> beta-amyloid </e1>  25-35 is not altered by pretreatment with the calcium channel blockers nifedipine or cobalt, with the depleter of intracellular calcium stores cyclopiazonic acid, or with the  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  inhibitor neomycin
False	In HVSMC both  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  and AVP increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production and [Ca2+]i response, but the efficacy of the responses was greater for  <e2> oxytocin </e2>  than AVP
True	In contrast, the potencies of  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  to raise  <e2> IP </e2>  and [Ca2+]i were similar and independent of extracellular Ca2+, and could be suppressed by pertussis toxin and phorbol ester, but not by verapamil
True	Fasting, with or without leptin administration, did not affect BAT UCP-2 mRNA; however,  <e1> leptin </e1>  administration to ad libitum fed rats significantly increased BAT  <e2> UCP-2 </e2>  mRNA, to 138% of control
False	Overall, our data indicate that the normal processing of  <e1> PrP(c) </e1>  is up-regulated by protein kinase C but not  <e2> protein kinase A </e2>  in human cells and murine neurons
True	We conclude that  <e1> PKC </e1>  activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of  <e2> AVP </e2>  to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells
False	We measured concentrations of  <e1> NPY </e1>  and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular  <e2> leptin </e2>  administration
True	These results suggest that  <e1> APP-S </e1>  secretion and A beta production in NT2N neurons are regulated by the muscarinic/ <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  signal transduction pathway
False	However, the in vivo modulation of  <e1> leptin </e1>  and  <e2> UCPs </e2>  appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics
False	We examined plasma  <e1> leptin </e1> , leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle  <e2> UCP </e2>  subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system
False	These data demonstrate a  <e1> leptin </e1> -induced increase in energy expenditure in nonmutant rodents and suggest that one mechanism by which leptin increases energy expenditure is through increased thermogenesis in BAT, including increased expression of  <e2> UCP </e2> 
True	The second class of mutant, gse (GA sensitivity), differed principally in GA sensitivity, requiring approximately 100-fold higher [ <e1> GA3 </e1> ] for both leaf elongation and  <e2> alpha-amylase </e2>  production by aleurone
False	Interestingly, coinfusion of this regimen of NPY with the highly effective anorectic and body reducing effects of CNTF (5.0 microg/day) not only prevented the CNTF-induced anorexia and weight loss, but also normalized serum  <e1> leptin </e1>  concentrations and hypothalamic  <e2> NPY </e2>  gene expression

False	Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2,  <e1> leptin </e1> , uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and  <e2> UCP-3 </e2> , and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia
True	Interestingly, coinfusion of this regimen of  <e1> NPY </e1>  with the highly effective anorectic and body reducing effects of CNTF (5.0 microg/day) not only prevented the CNTF-induced anorexia and weight loss, but also normalized serum  <e2> leptin </e2>  concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression
False	The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of  <e1> UCP1 </e1> ,  <e2> UCP3 </e2>  and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT
True	The hydrophilic form of MDP released from the cells on stimulation with  <e1> insulin </e1>  was recognized by antibodies against the inositol 1,2-cyclic monophosphate cross-reacting determinant, indicating that it had been generated by cleavage of its GPI anchor through the action of a  <e2> phospholipase C </e2> 
False	These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced  <e1> insulin </e1>  release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both  <e2> PLC </e2>  as well as Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis

True	For example,  <e1> leptin </e1>  suppresses  <e2> neuropeptide Y </e2>  (NPY) expression in the arcuate nucleus
False	These results indicate that  <e1> UCP </e1>  gene expressions during pregnancy are regulated tissue-dependently, and up-regulation of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA may be due to increased  <e2> leptin </e2>  levels
False	In the present study we found that at increasing GA concentrations, increasing numbers of barley (Hordeum vulgare) cells showed the enhanced  <e1> amylase </e1>  secretion and vacuolation characteristic of the  <e2> GA </e2>  response
False	The data suggest that mammalian  <e1> insulin </e1> -sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the  <e2> insulin </e2>  signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase
True	Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with  <e1> insulin </e1>  causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and  <e2> phospholipase Cgamma1 </e2>  that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation.
True	In these cells,  <e1> AVP </e1>  also causes the translocation of  <e2> PKC </e2>  from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date
True	Overall, our data indicate that the normal processing of  <e1> PrP(c) </e1>  is up-regulated by  <e2> protein kinase C </e2>  but not protein kinase A in human cells and murine neurons
False	Obesity occurs in 60% of women after menopause and is characterized by an excess of adipose tissue that depends on several orexigenic ( <e1> neuropeptide Y </e1>  (NPY) stimulates carbohydrate ingestion, galanin stimulates fat intake) and anorectic ( <e2> leptin </e2> , cholecystokinin (CCK)) factors
False	To study if  <e1> leptin </e1>  also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of  <e2> UCP </e2>  messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured
True	However, leptin did constrain the enhanced  <e1> PLC </e1> -mediated  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice
False	In conclusion, 1)  <e1> UCP-2 </e1>  messenger ribonucleic acid expression in sc adipose tissue is inversely related to adiposity and independently linked to local plasma leptin levels; and 2)  <e2> UCP-2 </e2>  expression is not acutely regulated by food intake, insulin, or fatty acids
False	This indicates that the calcium response to  <e1> OT </e1>  application was principally associated with activation of the  <e2> IP3 </e2> -sensitive calcium stores
True	These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic  <e1> NPY </e1>  mRNA by  <e2> leptin </e2>  may be impaired with age
False	The second class of mutant, gse (GA sensitivity), differed principally in  <e1> GA </e1>  sensitivity, requiring approximately 100-fold higher [GA3] for both leaf elongation and  <e2> alpha-amylase </e2>  production by aleurone

True	 <e1> Arginine vasopressin </e1>  (AVP) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to stimulate  <e2> protein kinase C </e2>  (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells
True	DNase1 footprints suggest the involvement of at least three types of transcription factors in the regulation of  <e1> alpha-Amy2/A </e1>  by  <e2> gibberellin </e2> 
False	The resulting abnormally phosphorylated PrPsc aggregates to freshly synthesized  <e1> PrPc </e1> , transforming it into same; due to a system of positive feedback invoked by the organophosphate-induced blockage of a  <e2> prion protein </e2> -specific protein kinase.
True	 <e1> Amyloid </e1>  beta protein disruption of cholinergic and growth factor  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  signals could underlie cognitive and neurodegerative aspects of Alzheimer's disease
True	The aggregated form of  <e1> A beta </e1>  25-35 significantly inhibited  <e2> PIP2-PLC </e2>  only in the presence of endogenous CaCl2
False	Thus, highly expressed in human adipocytes, the Y(1) receptor sustains the strong antilipolytic effect of  <e1> NPY </e1>  and exerts a positive action on  <e2> leptin </e2>  secretion
True	Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular  <e1> leptin </e1>  infusion on  <e2> uncoupling protein-3 </e2>  expression in rat muscle
False	These findings support the concept that the mitochondrial metabolism of nutrient molecules is an event sufficient to acutely augment  <e1> insulin </e1>  release from the beta cell, to increase phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and to induce time-dependent potentiation of  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion
True	In normal pancreatic islets,  <e1> UCP-2 </e1>  is upregulated by  <e2> leptin </e2>  and is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats

False	SP ewes also had greater incorporation of [3H]inositol into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (+3449%, p less than 0.01) and total inositol phosphate (IP) (+760%, p less than 0.08), in response to oxytocin, than did oCSP ewes (+553 and +168% for  <e1> IP3 </e1>  and total  <e2> IP </e2> , respectively) in endometrium collected at ovariectomy/hysterectomy on Day 16
False	In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus  <e1> insulin </e1>  in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the  <e2> GPI-PLC </e2> 
True	In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular  <e1> leptin </e1>  administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high UCP1, UCP2, and  <e2> UCP3 </e2>  expression in all these tissues
True	 <e1> Amyloid </e1>  beta protein (25-35) stimulation of  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  in LA-N-2 cells
True	 <e1> Leptin </e1>  increased LPL mRNA by 80%,  <e2> UCP1 </e2>  mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT
False	SP ewes also had greater incorporation of [3H]inositol into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (+3449%, p less than 0.01) and total  <e1> inositol phosphate </e1>  (IP) (+760%, p less than 0.08), in response to oxytocin, than did oCSP ewes (+553 and +168% for  <e2> IP3 </e2>  and total IP, respectively) in endometrium collected at ovariectomy/hysterectomy on Day 16
True	Further investigation suggested that activation of  <e1> protein kinase C </e1>  (PKC), which is part of the  <e2> AVP </e2> -induced intracellular signalling pathway, is necessary and sufficient for the generation of the synergistic response, although it is not obligatory for AVP-induced ACTH release
False	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma  <e1> leptin </e1> ,  <e2> NPY </e2> , and galanin between postmenopausal women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher NPY levels in both lean and obese postmenopausal women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be involved
True	Fasting significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 and  <e1> UCP-3 </e1>  mRNA expression, to 31% and 30% of ad libitum fed controls, respectively, effects which were prevented by administration of  <e2> leptin </e2>  to fasted rats
False	Aggregated  <e1> A(beta) </e1>  also decreased significantly the level of diacylglycerol, the product of  <e2> PLC </e2> 
False	Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after  <e1> OT </e1>  treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by  <e2> OT </e2> 
False	Overexpression of  <e1> PLC </e1> -beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on   <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion.
True	Endothelin-1 and  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  stimulated  <e2> inositol phosphate </e2>  accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells
False	Relative  <e1> UCP </e1>  expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for  <e2> UCP3 </e2>  in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively
False	These results indicate that  <e1> UCP </e1>  gene expressions during pregnancy are regulated tissue-dependently, and up-regulation of uterine UCP2 and  <e2> UCP3 </e2>  mRNA may be due to increased leptin levels
True	HvSPY coexpression largely abolished  <e1> GA3 </e1> -induced activity of an  <e2> alpha-amylase </e2>  promoter.

False	The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased  <e1> insulin </e1>  levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion was difficult to evaluate
True	Taken together, these data suggest that the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on plasma levels of  <e1> insulin </e1> , somatostatin and CCK may be mediated by  <e2> oxytocin </e2> 
True	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus oxytocin and  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  on [3H]  <e2> inositol phosphate </e2>  (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts

False	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma  <e1> leptin </e1> , NPY, and galanin between postmenopausal women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher  <e2> NPY </e2>  levels in both lean and obese postmenopausal women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be involved
False	In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular  <e1> uncoupling protein </e1>  (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were  <e2> leptin </e2> -negative, both in fed and fasted conditions
False	To elucidate the pathophysiologic significance of  <e1> UCP3 </e1>  and UCP2 in the effect of TZDs on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure, we examined their basal mRNA levels in the WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle from Wistar fatty rats, a rat model of NIDDM and obesity with  <e2> leptin </e2>  receptor defect, and investigated expression of the genes encoding UCP3 and UCP2 in Wistar fatty rats and in Wistar lean rats with 2-week oral administration of 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) pioglitazone, a TZD derivative
