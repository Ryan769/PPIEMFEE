False	The resulting abnormally phosphorylated  <e1> PrPsc </e1>  aggregates to freshly synthesized  <e2> PrPc </e2> , transforming it into same; due to a system of positive feedback invoked by the organophosphate-induced blockage of a prion protein-specific protein kinase.
True	A caveolin-1-dependent coupling of  <e1> PrPc </e1>  to the  <e2> tyrosine kinase Fyn </e2>  was observed

False	Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal  <e1> prion protein </e1>  isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular  <e2> prion protein </e2>  isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a prion protein-specific kinase
False	ARC  <e1> NPY </e1>  neurones also mediate hyperphagia and obesity in the ob/ob and db/db mice and fa/fa rat, in which leptin inhibition is lost through mutations affecting  <e2> leptin </e2>  or its receptor

True	When this parental line was treated with  <e1> PI-PLC </e1> , Abeta40,  <e2> Abeta42 </e2> , and sAPPbeta decreased to levels similar to those observed in the mutant line, and the mutant line was resistant to these effects of PI-PLC
False	These results demonstrate that chronic central infusion to produce a persistent elevation of the cytokine at pathophysiological levels (a situation that may normally manifest during infection, injury and inflammation) produced severe anorexia and weight loss in conjunction with reduction in both serum  <e1> leptin </e1>  concentrations and hypothalamic  <e2> NPY </e2>  gene expression

True	Furthermore, in SN-56/OBR cells both CNTF and  <e1> leptin </e1>  produce changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype characteristic of cholinergic neurons, such as an increase in choline acetyltransferase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and a decrease in  <e2> neuropeptide Y </e2>  expression
False	To determine the functional significance of the interaction of  <e1> PLCgamma </e1>  and the IR, we used a specific inhibitor of  <e2> PLC </e2> , U73122, or microinjection of SH2 domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from PLCgamma to block insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation

False	However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of  <e1> phospholipase Cgamma1 </e1>  at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of  <e2> insulin </e2> - stimulated cells.

False	Although the above data are consistent with a direct ability of  <e1> leptin </e1>  to promote TRH biosynthesis through actions on TRH neurons, addition of a-MSH produced a 3.5 fold increase in TRH biosynthesis and release, whereas  <e2> NPY </e2>  treatment suppressed ~3 fold proTRH biosynthesis
True	Dietary intakes of flavonols,  <e1> flavones </e1>  and isoflavones by Japanese women and the inverse correlation between quercetin intake and plasma LDL  <e2> cholesterol </e2>  concentration

False	Sympathetic inhibition,  <e1> leptin </e1> , and  <e2> uncoupling protein </e2>  subtype expression in normal fasting rats
False	These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2,  <e1> leptin </e1> , UCP-2,  <e2> UCP-3 </e2> , and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins
True	Summing up, new evidence suggests that  <e1> NPY </e1>  and  <e2> leptin </e2>  may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level
False	Thus  <e1> NPY </e1>  stimulates the responses used to obtain food but inhibits those used to consume food, and  <e2> leptin </e2>  has the opposite effects
True	Furthermore, our 14C-acetate-labeling studies showed a 50% reduction in  <e1> cholesteryl ester </e1>  synthesis in the presence of either  <e2> flavonoid </e2> , which could account for the reduction in net apoB secretion caused by incubation with these compounds

True	However, in brown fat, we observed a 2-3-fold increase in the expression of  <e1> UCP1 </e1>  in response to dietary fat challenge, which may be related to diet-induced elevations in plasma  <e2> leptin </e2>  levels
False	Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells;  <e1> PKC </e1>  inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of  <e2> PKCalpha </e2> , betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the AVP-induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms
True	 <e1> Leptin </e1>  may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of  <e2> neuropeptide Y </e2>  (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART).
False	Co-expression of PLD1 with  <e1> phospholipase C (PLC)gamma </e1>  has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an  <e2> insulin </e2> -dependent manner.

False	We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the  <e1> AVP </e1> -induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of  <e2> PKC </e2>  activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.

False	These results suggest that central  <e1> leptin </e1>  stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle  <e2> UCP-3 </e2>  expression

True	These results indicate that  <e1> PKC </e1>  is upstream of the phosphorylation, a motion which is supported by the fact that the  <e2> AVP </e2> -stimulated phosphorylation was downregulated by phorbol esters
False	In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular leptin administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high  <e1> UCP1 </e1> ,  <e2> UCP2 </e2> , and UCP3 expression in all these tissues
False	Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel),  <e1> PLC </e1>  and  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta
False	To determine the functional significance of the interaction of PLCgamma and the IR, we used a specific inhibitor of PLC, U73122, or microinjection of SH2 domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from  <e1> PLCgamma </e1>  to block  <e2> insulin </e2> -stimulated GLUT4 translocation
False	The total intake of flavonoids was inversely correlated with the plasma total  <e1> cholesterol </e1>  concentration (TC) (r = -0.236, P: < 0.05) and plasma LDL  <e2> cholesterol </e2>  concentration (LDL-C) (r = -0.220, P: < 0.05), after the adjustment for age, body mass index and total energy intake
False	During luteinization of bovine granulosa cells in vitro in the presence of  <e1> insulin </e1> , or  <e2> insulin </e2>  plus forskolin, there is a massive upregulation not only of progesterone production, but also of the gene for the peptide hormone oxytocin, with secretion of the peptide into the medium
False	UCP2,  <e1> UCP3 </e1>  and  <e2> leptin </e2>  gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin
False	Amyloid beta protein stimulation of  <e1> phospholipase C </e1>  was absent from LA-N-2 cells previously treated with norepinephrine, trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), bombesin, or  <e2> amyloid </e2>  beta peptide
False	To elucidate the pathophysiologic significance of UCP3 and UCP2 in the effect of TZDs on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure, we examined their basal mRNA levels in the WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle from Wistar fatty rats, a rat model of NIDDM and obesity with leptin receptor defect, and investigated expression of the genes encoding  <e1> UCP3 </e1>  and  <e2> UCP2 </e2>  in Wistar fatty rats and in Wistar lean rats with 2-week oral administration of 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) pioglitazone, a TZD derivative
True	To assess the possible involvement of  <e1> PKC </e1>  in  <e2> AVP </e2>  and IL-1 action in Leydig cells, the PKC inhibitor Calphostin C was tested
False	Moreover, A beta 25-35 had no effect on basal PIP2-PLC activity and cytosolic  <e1> PI-PLC </e1>  and  <e2> PIP2-PLC </e2> 
True	Similarly, central  <e1> leptin </e1>  treatment also had a greater effect in suppressing hypothalamic  <e2> NPY </e2>  mRNA expression in young (-23+/-4%) than in old (-8+/-4%) rats compared with their age-matched pair-fed treated rats
False	These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that  <e1> PLC </e1>  activation can clearly be dissociated from insulin secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion
False	In the present study we found that at increasing  <e1> GA </e1>  concentrations, increasing numbers of barley (Hordeum vulgare) cells showed the enhanced amylase secretion and vacuolation characteristic of the  <e2> GA </e2>  response
False	When this parental line was treated with PI-PLC,  <e1> Abeta40 </e1> ,  <e2> Abeta42 </e2> , and sAPPbeta decreased to levels similar to those observed in the mutant line, and the mutant line was resistant to these effects of PI-PLC
True	In conclusion, 1)  <e1> UCP-2 </e1>  messenger ribonucleic acid expression in sc adipose tissue is inversely related to adiposity and independently linked to local plasma  <e2> leptin </e2>  levels; and 2) UCP-2 expression is not acutely regulated by food intake, insulin, or fatty acids
True	2) IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin also induced a Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum:  <e1> phospholipase C </e1>  (PLC) inhibitors, neomycin, or U-73122 partially blocked the intracellular [Ca2+]i increase induced by IGF-1 and  <e2> insulin </e2>  and totally inhibited the effect of IGF-2
True	Propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, 7-chloro-kynurenic acid, a metabotropic amino acid antagonist, and [Tyr4-D-Phe12]bombesin, a bombesin antagonist, blunted the  <e1> A beta P </e1>  stimulation of  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  activity in [3H]inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells
False	Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular  <e1> prion protein </e1>  isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal  <e2> prion protein </e2>  isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a prion protein-specific kinase
False	A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking  <e1> leptin </e1> -induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in  <e2> UCP-3 </e2> 
False	Mean numbers of  <e1> AVP </e1> - and  <e2> protein kinase Calpha </e2> -immunoreactive neurons were determined in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of common voles, entrained to a 12:12 h light-dark (LD) cycle, at the beginning of the light period (zeitgeber time zero) and 6 h later (zeitgeber time six)
False	Although X-Pro aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.9) is GPI-anchored in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as shown by digestion with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, it was not released upon  <e1> insulin </e1>  treatment of the cells, indicating that only a subset of the GPI-anchored proteins are susceptible to  <e2> insulin </e2> -stimulated release
False	We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does  <e1> PKC </e1>  trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of  <e2> PKC </e2>  activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.
False	Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of  <e1> PLC </e1> -beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated  <e2> insulin </e2>   secretion.
False	To assess the possible involvement of  <e1> PKC </e1>  in AVP and IL-1 action in Leydig cells, the  <e2> PKC </e2>  inhibitor Calphostin C was tested
False	Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for  <e1> UCP3 </e1>  in ad libitum fed control rats, in  <e2> leptin </e2> -treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively
False	As the  <e1> GPI-PLC </e1>  reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when  <e2> insulin </e2>  was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone
False	The second class of mutant, gse ( <e1> GA </e1>  sensitivity), differed principally in GA sensitivity, requiring approximately 100-fold higher [GA3] for both leaf elongation and  <e2> alpha-amylase </e2>  production by aleurone
False	While leptin maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms (UCP1,  <e1> UCP2 </e1> , and  <e2> UCP3 </e2> ), the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats
True	The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated  <e1> phospholipase C </e1>  isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretory responses under these unique conditions
True	RESULTS:  <e1> Oxy </e1>  increased  <e2> insulin </e2>  release and [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner
False	All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency:  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 >  <e2> IP3 </e2> 
False	A negative correlation between WAT O2 consumption and UCP2 expression was found in control animals, but not in the cafeteria-fed groups, suggesting a differential response to the beta3-adrenergic compound in lean and obese animals, which is in agreement with the reported statistical interactions between obesity and Trecadrine administration found for WAT O2 consumption and muscle  <e1> UCP2 </e1>  expression, as well as for plasma  <e2> leptin </e2>  and WAT leptin expression
False	Further, the  <e1> oxytocin </e1> -induced activation of IK(sl) was effectively antagonized by 5 x 10(-8) mol/l U-73122 or 5 x 10(-6) mol/l 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate (inhibitors of the cell membrane phospholipase C), as well as by intracellularly applied heparin (selective inhibitor of  <e2> inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate </e2>  (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release channels)
True	These results support the hypothesis that the heart may be a target organ for AVP and that  <e1> AVP </e1>  modulates IL-1beta-induced iNOS expression in myocytes through the V1a receptor, which is mediated at least partially via activation of  <e2> protein kinase C </e2> 
False	Homogeneous liposome immunoassay for  <e1> insulin </e1>  using  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  from Clostridium perfringens
True	In the present study we found that at increasing  <e1> GA </e1>  concentrations, increasing numbers of barley (Hordeum vulgare) cells showed the enhanced  <e2> amylase </e2>  secretion and vacuolation characteristic of the GA response
False	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  and  <e2> oxytocin </e2>  on [3H] inositol phosphate (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts
True	There was also a very significant increase of  <e1> IP1 </e1>  after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and IP1 and IP3 when 1000 mU hCG plus  <e2> oxytocin </e2>  were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively)
True	It is concluded that the primary action of PGF2 alpha in myometrial cells is to enhance Ca2+ influx, whereas  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  and ET-1 receptors are coupled to phospholipase C, generating  <e2> IP3 </e2>  and raising the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ from intracellular as well as extracellular sources
False	U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the  <e1> Oxy </e1> -induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the Oxy-induced increase in  <e2> insulin </e2>  release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively
False	These results suggest that  <e1> APP-S </e1>  secretion and  <e2> A beta </e2>  production in NT2N neurons are regulated by the muscarinic/phospholipase C signal transduction pathway
False	Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of  <e1> PKC-alpha </e1>  and -delta, but not  <e2> PKC-epsilon </e2> , and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP
True	Hesperidin, the most important  <e1> flavanone </e1>  of Citrus sp., significantly increases HDL and lowers  <e2> cholesterol </e2> , LDL, total lipid and triglyceride plasma levels in normolipidemic rats and in rats with diet- and triton-induced hyperlipidemia
False	Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%,  <e1> UCP1 </e1>  mRNA twofold, and  <e2> UCP3 </e2>  mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT
False	Plasma insulin, cholecystokinin, galanin,  <e1> neuropeptide Y </e1>  and  <e2> leptin </e2>  levels in obese women with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus
False	The effects of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and  <e1> inositol phosphate </e1>  (IP) generation in human myometrial cells were evaluated and compared to the effects of  <e2> oxytocin </e2> 
True	These findings led us to conclude that inositol trisphosphate [corrected] causes Ca2+ mobilization by muscarinic activation of  <e1> PLC </e1> , leading to intracellular translocation of  <e2> insulin </e2>  granules to the ready-releasable pool in pancreatic beta-cells via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chains
