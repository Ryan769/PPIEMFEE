True	While  <e1> leptin </e1>  maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms ( <e2> UCP1 </e2> , UCP2, and UCP3), the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats
False	However, the  <e1> AVP </e1> -dependent stimulation required activation of protein kinase C (PKC), whereas the inhibition was  <e2> PKC </e2>  independent, indicating that the NGF-induced signaling pathways leading to inhibition and stimulation of HCO3- absorption are distinct
False	CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the  <e1> leptin </e1>  gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the  <e2> ucp </e2>  family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways

True	When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of  <e1> PLC </e1>  is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release
False	When this parental line was treated with  <e1> PI-PLC </e1> , Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta decreased to levels similar to those observed in the mutant line, and the mutant line was resistant to these effects of  <e2> PI-PLC </e2> 
False	Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal  <e1> prion protein </e1>  isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular prion protein isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal  <e2> prion protein </e2>  isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a prion protein-specific kinase

False	To determine the functional significance of the interaction of PLCgamma and the IR, we used a specific inhibitor of  <e1> PLC </e1> , U73122, or microinjection of SH2 domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from  <e2> PLCgamma </e2>  to block insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation

False	Our data demonstrate, that activation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase alone is sufficient to promote  <e1> APP </e1>  secretion, whereas inhibition of MAP kinase will reduce APP secretion only when  <e2> phospholipase Cgamma </e2>  or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are additionally inhibited
True	These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the  <e1> gibberellin </e1> -induced expression of  <e2> alpha-amylase </e2>  molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed

True	These results show that  <e1> AVP </e1> -induced AA release in H9c2 cells is secondary to activation of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCP pathway, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of  <e2> PKCalpha </e2> , betaI, epsilon, and delta
False	These findings support the concept that the mitochondrial metabolism of nutrient molecules is an event sufficient to acutely augment insulin release from the beta cell, to increase  <e1> phospholipase C </e1> -mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and to induce time-dependent potentiation of  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion
False	To study the effects of enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis on insulin secretion, phosphoinositide-specific  <e1> phospholipase Cbeta1 </e1>  (PLCbeta1) or  <e2> PLCdelta1 </e2>  was overexpressed in insulinoma MIN6 cells via adenoviral vectors.

False	Inhibition of  <e1> PLC </e1>  activation did not impair either EGF- or insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase or incorporation of glucose into lipid, supporting the hypothesis that both EGF- and  <e2> insulin </e2> -induced glucose disposal can be independent of GLUT4-mediated glucose transport.
False	A specific enhancement in  <e1> PLC </e1> -mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action
True	In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular  <e1> leptin </e1>  administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high  <e2> UCP1 </e2> , UCP2, and UCP3 expression in all these tissues

True	It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the  <e1> gibberellin </e1> -induced expression of  <e2> alpha-amylase </e2>  in both secretory tissues
True	The present study indicates that  <e1> leptin </e1>  increases the gene expression of  <e2> UCP2 </e2>  in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT
False	These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that PLC activation can clearly be dissociated from  <e1> insulin </e1>  secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion
True	The  <e1> PKC inhibitors </e1>  Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or  <e2> AVP </e2> 
False	Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular prion protein isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal  <e1> prion protein </e1>  isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a  <e2> prion protein </e2> -specific kinase
False	 <e1> Amyloid </e1>  beta protein stimulation of phospholipase C was absent from LA-N-2 cells previously treated with norepinephrine, trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), bombesin, or  <e2> amyloid </e2>  beta peptide
False	Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for  <e1> UCP1 </e1> , 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for  <e2> UCP3 </e2>  in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively
False	These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that  <e1> PLC </e1>  activation can clearly be dissociated from  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion
False	Phorbol myristate acetate (TPA), an activator of  <e1> PKC </e1> , elicited an increase of MAPK activity, but did not further influence the level of  <e2> AVP </e2> 4-8-enhanced MAPK activity; Nevertheless, the extent of CaMKII activation was attenuated by TPA
False	Inhibition of  <e1> PLC </e1>  activation did not impair either EGF- or  <e2> insulin </e2> -induced activation of glycogen synthase or incorporation of glucose into lipid, supporting the hypothesis that both EGF- and insulin-induced glucose disposal can be independent of GLUT4-mediated glucose transport.
False	A negative correlation between WAT O2 consumption and  <e1> UCP2 </e1>  expression was found in control animals, but not in the cafeteria-fed groups, suggesting a differential response to the beta3-adrenergic compound in lean and obese animals, which is in agreement with the reported statistical interactions between obesity and Trecadrine administration found for WAT O2 consumption and muscle UCP2 expression, as well as for plasma leptin and WAT  <e2> leptin </e2>  expression
True	A specific enhancement in  <e1> PLC </e1> -mediated  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action

False	U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the  <e1> Oxy </e1> -induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the  <e2> Oxy </e2> -induced increase in insulin release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively
True	Tolbutamide and diazoxide modulate  <e1> phospholipase C </e1> -linked Ca(2+) signaling and  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion in beta-cells
False	The expression of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 were up-regulated by 3.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, during the late stage of pregnancy with an increase of WAT  <e1> leptin </e1>  mRNA expression and exogenous administration of leptin resulted in induction of the uterine  <e2> UCP2 </e2>  and UCP3 levels
True	Secreted form of  <e1> beta-amyloid </e1>  precursor protein activates protein kinase C and  <e2> phospholipase Cgamma1 </e2>  in cultured embryonic rat neocortical cells
False	These results confirm that AVP and PMA activate  <e1> PKC </e1>  and indicate that IL-1 likely does not activate  <e2> PKC </e2>  in Leydig cells
True	The  <e1> gibberellin </e1> -responsive elements conserved in cereal  <e2> alpha-amylase </e2>  genes are not included in the 5'-upstream region of Rep1 or RepA
False	Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with  <e1> PLCgamma </e1>  allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an  <e2> insulin </e2> -dependent manner.
False	Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by  <e1> PKC </e1>  in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether  <e2> AVP </e2>  might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH
False	A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated  <e1> insulin </e1>  secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action
True	It has been established that  <e1> amyloid </e1>  beta peptide (AbetaP) activates phospholipase A2,  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  and phospholipase D of LA-N-2 cells and other cell types
False	However,  <e1> NPY </e1>  inhibited and  <e2> leptin </e2>  stimulated intake if the solution was infused intraorally
False	Relative to the wild type, the GA(3)-treated aleurone layer of d1 had lower expression of Ramy1A, which encodes  <e1> alpha-amylase </e1> , and OsGAMYB, which encodes a  <e2> GA </e2> -inducible transcriptional factor, and no increase in expression of Ca(2 +)-ATPase
True	Three experiments (Exp) assessed the influence of stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins (oCSP) on turnover of  <e1> inositol trisphosphate </e1>  (the putative second-messenger for  <e2> oxytocin </e2> -stimulated secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha) in ovine endometrium during luteolysis and maternal recognition of pregnancy
True	These data suggest that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation at a step involving GTP-binding protein/PLC coupling can exert a negative effect on the stimulation of  <e1> IP3 </e1>  formation by  <e2> oxytocin </e2>  and thereby affect contraction/relaxation in the myometrium
True	The resulting abnormally phosphorylated PrPsc aggregates to freshly synthesized PrPc, transforming it into same; due to a system of positive feedback invoked by the organophosphate-induced blockage of a  <e1> prion protein </e1> -specific  <e2> protein kinase </e2> .
False	Denervation suppressed mRNA levels for  <e1> UCP-2 </e1>  (49%),  <e2> UCP-3 </e2>  (36%), and COX-IV (59%) and eliminated the acute response to leptin in SM
False	When this parental line was treated with PI-PLC, Abeta40,  <e1> Abeta42 </e1> , and sAPPbeta decreased to levels similar to those observed in the mutant line, and the mutant line was resistant to these effects of  <e2> PI-PLC </e2> 
True	We also determined whether well known hypothalamic neuropeptide targets, e.g.  <e1> neuropeptide Y </e1>  (NPY), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) were regulated in a pattern consistent with their presumed roles as mediators of  <e2> leptin </e2>  action
True	A loop system exists between hypothalamic  <e1> neuropeptide Y </e1>  (NPY) and peripheral adipose tissue  <e2> leptin </e2>  to maintain normal body homeostasis
False	The  <e1> oxytocin </e1>  antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on  <e2> oxytocin </e2> -induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate
False	The etiology for diabetes mellitus in PWS may be related to the morbid obesity and consequent  <e1> insulin </e1>  resistance, because a decrease of  <e2> oxytocin </e2>  neurons and leptin resistance in PWS may cause hyperphagia, inducing obesity
False	Inhibition of 5-HT3 serotonergic receptors with ondansetron (4 or 8 mg) did not modify the basal secretion of AVP and  <e1> OT </e1>  and the OT response to  <e2> insulin </e2> -induced hypoglycemia
False	When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of  <e1> insulin </e1>  secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered  <e2> insulin </e2>  release
True	The total intake of  <e1> flavonoids </e1>  was inversely correlated with the plasma total cholesterol concentration (TC) (r = -0.236, P: < 0.05) and plasma LDL  <e2> cholesterol </e2>  concentration (LDL-C) (r = -0.220, P: < 0.05), after the adjustment for age, body mass index and total energy intake
True	SP ewes also had greater incorporation of [3H]inositol into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (+3449%, p less than 0.01) and total  <e1> inositol phosphate </e1>  (IP) (+760%, p less than 0.08), in response to  <e2> oxytocin </e2> , than did oCSP ewes (+553 and +168% for IP3 and total IP, respectively) in endometrium collected at ovariectomy/hysterectomy on Day 16
True	The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on  <e1> oxytocin </e1> -induced  <e2> insulin </e2>  secretion was difficult to evaluate
True	These results indicate that oTP-1 may prevent luteolysis by inhibiting development of endometrial responsiveness to oxytocin and, therefore, reduce  <e1> oxytocin </e1> -induced synthesis of  <e2> IP3 </e2>  and PGF2 alpha
False	The effects of full-length  <e1> amyloid </e1>  beta protein, A(beta) (1-40), on phosphoinositide-specific  <e2> phospholipase C </e2>  (PLC) were investigated in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) and cytosol prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult rats
