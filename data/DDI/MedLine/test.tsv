effect	CRM197 induced apoptosis, and furthermore, the combination of  <e1> CRM197 </e1>  plus  <e2> doxorubicin </e2>  enhanced cytotoxicity in a T-ALL cell line. 
effect	We concluded that the combined administration of  <e1> dexmedetomidine </e1>  with  <e2> ephedrine </e2>  may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation, which limits the use of dexmedetomidine as an analgesic in humans.
false	saline + saline,  <e1> ephedrine </e1>  (10   mg/kg) + saline, saline + dexmedetomidine (15     g/kg) and ephedrine (10   mg/kg) +  <e2> dexmedetomidine </e2>  (15     g/kg), intraperitoneally, 30 min before hot plate or holed open field tests. 
false	In the hot plate test in mice, co-administration of 15     g/kg  <e1> dexmedetomidine </e1>  with 10   mg/kg ephedrine intraperitoneally not only enhanced, but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by  <e2> dexmedetomidine </e2> . 
false	We concluded that the combined administration of  <e1> dexmedetomidine </e1>  with ephedrine may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation, which limits the use of  <e2> dexmedetomidine </e2>  as an analgesic in humans.
false	Rate of achievement of target BP with fixed combination  <e1> amlodipine </e1> / <e2> valsartan </e2>  (93%) was comparable with that on traditional therapy (90%). 
false	We have demonstrated appropriateness of inhospital administration of fixed  <e1> amlodipine </e1> /valsartan combination as an approach allowing to achieve target BP in shorter time, with the use of fewer  <e2> antihypertensive drugs </e2> , and diminishing concealed inefficacy of treatment.
false	It will compete with  <e1> clopidogrel </e1>  (Plavix) and  <e2> prasugrel </e2>  (Effient) for such use. 
effect	The FDA has approved ticagrelor ( <e1> Brilinta </e1> -AstraZeneca), an oral antiplatelet drug, for use with low-dose  <e2> aspirin </e2>  to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 
false	It will compete with  <e1> clopidogrel </e1>  (Plavix) and prasugrel ( <e2> Effient </e2> ) for such use. 
false	Ticagrelor ( <e1> Brilinta </e1> )--better than  <e2> clopidogrel </e2>  (Plavix)
mechanism	The synergistic antinociception activity of  <e1> ibuprofen </e1>  when administered with  <e2> piperine </e2>  can be attributed to increased plasma concentration of ibuprofen. 
false	In the present study piperine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the dose-dependent antinociceptive activity of  <e1> ibuprofen </e1>  evaluated by both  <e2> acetic acid </e2>  writhing and formalin test, when it was administered with ibuprofen. 
false	In the present study piperine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the dose-dependent antinociceptive activity of ibuprofen evaluated by both  <e1> acetic acid </e1>  writhing and formalin test, when it was administered with  <e2> ibuprofen </e2> .
